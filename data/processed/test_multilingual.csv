"U.S. 'making a lot of progress' on North Korea issue: Trump. NEW YORK (Reuters) - President Donald Trump said on Thursday the United States was making progress on the North Korean issue, ahead of an expected sanctions announcement by Washington over Pyongyang s ballistic and nuclear weapons program.  I think we re making a lot of progress in a lot of ways,  Trump said before going into a meeting with South Korean President Moon Jae-in on the sidelines of the U.N. General Assembly. ",0,en

"OBAMA CRITICIZES TRUMP For Comments About Illegals And Muslim Refugees…But What About THIS Video Of Obama’s Top 5 Most Violent Quotes About AMERICAN CITIZENS?. President Obama, who as a candidate once urged supporters to  bring a gun  to the knife fight of his campaign, on Tuesday decried  vicious  rhetoric from Republican presidential candidates.Here is a great compilation of Obama s top 5 hits on his opponent (50% of America). Can you imagine the comments that haven t been recorded, like at the recent meeting with Black Lives Matter terrorists who were invited guests of Barack Obama s, coincidentally just prior to the organized Chicago Trump rally riots?During the annual  Friends of Ireland  luncheon at the U.S. Capitol, Mr. Obama told a bipartisan group of lawmakers that he is  more than a little dismayed about what s happening on the campaign trail lately. Never one to miss out on the opportunity to bash his enemies our very un-statesman like Community Organizer In Chief took the opportunity when speaking in front of the Prime Minister of Ireland to not talk about relations with Ireland, but instead, to bash Donald Trump. He made it clear to this group who has absolutely nothing to do with our elections, that he is watching his every move Trump makes and will use every opportunity, no matter how inappropriate, to damage his reputation. Probably the most sickening and dishonest part of this video is when Obama begrudgingly tells Speaker Of The House, Paul Ryan (R) that, I know you are a great father and a great husband  and that, We can have political debates without turning on each other  at the 7:45 mark: We have heard vulgar and divisive rhetoric aimed at women and minorities   at Americans who don t look like  us,  or pray like  us  or vote like we do,  Mr. Obama said in an obvious reference to Republican presidential front-runner Donald Trump.  We ve seen misguided attempts to shut down that speech, however offensive it may be. In response to those attempts, we ve seen actual violence, and we ve heard silence from too many of our leaders. As he has increasingly in recent days, Mr. Obama lamented  any effort to spread fear or encourage violence, or to shut people down when they re trying to speak, or turn Americans against one another. As a citizen who will still be leading this office, I will not support somebody who practices that kind of politics,  the president said.But as a candidate for the White House in 2008, Mr. Obama was no stranger to violent rhetoric. He encouraged the notion that he was a product of Chicago s particularly tough brand of politics.At a campaign event in Philadelphia in June 2008, Mr. Obama told supporters,  If they bring a knife to the fight, we bring a gun. Because from what I understand, folks in Philly like a good brawl. I ve seen Eagles fans. Later that year, as polls showed a close race between Mr. Obama and Republican nominee John McCain, Mr. Obama urged a crowd of about 1,500 at a campaign rally in Elko, Nevada, to get confrontational in their community for him. I need you to go out and talk to your friends and talk to your neighbors,  Mr. Obama said.  I want you to talk to them whether they are independent or whether they are Republican. I want you to argue with them and get in their face. The president on Tuesday seemed to be referring to such comments of his own when he remarked,  All of us can recall some intemperate words that we regret. Certainly, I can. And while some may be more to blame than others for the current climate, all of us are responsible for reversing it. Via: Washington Times",1,en

"Cambodian PM leaves for China to seek more aid. PHNOM PENH (Reuters) - Cambodian Prime Minister Hun Sen, facing Western donor pressure over a crackdown on critics ahead of 2018 elections, will seek more aid and investment from China during a visit this week, his aide said on Wednesday. China is already Cambodia s biggest donor and its support has bolstered Hun Sen in the face of criticism of what his opponents say amounts to the destruction of democracy. The aide, Sry Thamrong, said Hun Sen would attend a special summit from Thursday to Sunday held by the ruling Communist Party on a theme espoused by Chinese President Xi Jinping on turning the world for the better and without interference.  The aim of Hun Sen s meetings to discuss aid and investment with Xi and Chinese investors is to create more jobs in Cambodia, he said.  Especially, we need more bridges on the Mekong River, we also need many more roads, trains, sky train,  Sry Thamrong told reporters at the international airport in Phnom Penh, the capital, before the departure.  These are the things we need in the future.   China has supported Cambodia s crackdown, making no criticism of the government, which is one of Beijing s most important allies in Southeast Asia after more than three decades in power.     The supreme court this month banned the opposition Cambodia National Rescue Party (CNRP) at the government s request. That followed the arrest of its leader Kem Sokha for plotting to take power with American help. The United States has stopped election funding ahead of next year s general election and threatened further concrete steps. The European Union has raised a potential threat to Cambodia s duty free access. Washington is working on a review of its ties with Cambodia after the dissolution of the CNRP, William Heidt, the U.S. ambassador to Cambodia said.   That is something we are taking very seriously, having a very serious review of our policies towards Cambodia,  he told broadcaster Voice of America in an interview on Wednesday. ",0,en

"Puerto Rico either gets legislative fix or humanitarian aid: Congressman. NEW YORK (Reuters) - Puerto Rico’s debt crisis, if left unaddressed by the U.S. Congress where legislation has stalled in the House Natural Resources Committee, will result in the need to pay for a humanitarian aid package, Congressman Raul Grijalva said on Thursday. Grijalva, the ranking Democrat on the HNRC from Arizona, said in a teleconference with reporters that it is an “either/or” situation as Puerto Rico faces $70 billion in debt it cannot pay off and a growing humanitarian crisis because it cannot afford maintaining basic social services. “Either we begin this process, stabilize, create some carve out opportunities for essential services and/or wait for the crisis to get worse and then have to respond with humanitarian relief,” Grijalva said, adding that a new draft of the bill had not been made available as of Thursday morning. Grijalva visited Puerto Rico this week and met with the island’s leadership and toured its main medical facilities. He said austerity alone is not going to stay the situation of degraded conditions for health, nutrition and education. “People talk about a bailout. Thus far there is no money being talked about extended by the United States government,” Grijalva said, adding: “We are talking about a piece of legislation that provides for a method of restructuring and for some accountability attached to that restructuring.” The Republican chairman of the HNRC, Rob Bishop of Utah, said he wants a bipartisan bill to emerge from committee but canceled an expected release of the legislation on Wednesday while lawmakers hashed out language revolving around the status of the island of Vieques, pensions and minimum wage rates. Puerto Rico defaulted on May 1 for a third time on some of its debt, missing a roughly $400 million payment owed by the Government Development Bank, the island’s main fiscal agent. It faces a near $2 billion July 1 debt payment. The legislation’s basic structure still includes the creation of an independent oversight board to lead the restructuring of the U.S. commonwealth’s credit and work with the local government to develop an economic reform plan. On the issue of Vieques, Democrats are concerned the language regarding the transfer of federal land on the island, which is mainly a nature preserve, could leave it vulnerable to commercial development in the name of recreation. “Our position has been from the beginning that Vieques did not belong in this package of legislation,” said Grijalva.

"Officials found list of targets with 5,000 names in east German raid: media. BERLIN (Reuters) - German officials found lists with over 5,000 names of possible targets, including over 100 politicians, during the raids on the homes and workplaces of two terrorism suspects in the east German state of Mecklenburg-Vorpommern last week, Die Welt newspaper reported on Friday. The newspaper, citing security sources, said one of the suspects, a former policeman who has since been suspended, is believed to have used his office computer to search out the addresses of political opponents. German police on Aug. 28 raided the homes and workplaces of the policeman and another person suspected of planning to capture and kill politicians because of their views on immigration, authorities said. The newspaper report marked the first substantial details that have emerged about the case. At the time, the federal prosecutor s office said the suspects, who feared Germany s refugee policies would impoverish the country, had begun to stockpile food and ammunition and plan attacks. The newspaper said there were no indications thus far of surveillance of the people on the lists, or of any concrete murder plans. Much of the information was publicly available, the paper cited the sources as saying. Federal police officials seized two binders filled with names of over 5,000 people during searches of the properties of one of the suspects, an attorney and a local politician in Rostock, a northern city. It said the politicians on the list belonged to a wide range of parties, including Chancellor Angela Merkel s conservatives. ",0,en

" Trump Will HATE This Mexican Magazine For Unmasking Him On Their Cover (IMAGE). Mexico does not like Donald Trump, and for good reason. He s accused their people of being rapists and killers, said that the country is deliberately sending their trash up to us to deal with, and we all know about the wall he wants to force Mexico to pay for. One Mexican literary magazine, called Letras Libres, decided to illustrate what they think of Trump after all of this. Their October issue features him on the cover, and it s not in a flattering light:En nuestro n mero de octubre: pic.twitter.com/xhMFnU9ttR  Letras Libres (@Letras_Libres) September 28, 2016That  stache is reminiscent of Hitler s mustache and reads  fascista Americana,  or,  American fascist. Suffice it to say, the editors at Letras Libres aren t thrilled with Trump, either.One expert on the history of fascism said that Trump s nonstop, offensive ethnic stereotyping, and his fear-the-foreigners rhetoric are textbook fascism. Mexico is a foreign country. Their people are foreigners, and Trump likes to claim they re stealing our jobs, both inside and outside our borders. He hates them and he wants us to hate them.His ability to convince his loyal subjects that the country is in serious decline, when it isn t, is likewise textbook fascism. He s got the entire world worried, confused as to how he could even have gotten this far in a U.S. election cycle, and just generally pissed the hell off.One thing he did recently was complain that Mexico forces us to pay a tax to sell products there, but they can sell their products here without paying the same tax. Mexico has a value-added tax that American companies must pay when they sell products there, but Mexican companies have to pay that same tax to sell in their own country, even though they don t have to pay it here. Our companies don t pay it here either.Trump listed that as one of his millions of reasons that NAFTA is needs to be torn up. Trump doesn t know what he s talking about. But that is, in fact, just another claim that Mexico is stealing from us, and must be stopped.In other words, Letras Libres sees Trump for what he is. He may not quite be Hitler or Mussolini (yet, mostly because he s not in charge yet), but he s definitely got a very strong fascist streak.Featured image by Win McNamee/Getty Images",1,en

"Illinois House to take up governor's budget, tax vetoes. CHICAGO (Reuters) - The fate of a spending plan and tax hike aimed at ending Illinois’ unprecedented two-year budget impasse moved on Tuesday to the Democratic-controlled House of Representatives, which will seek to enact the legislation by overriding the Republican governor’s vetoes. Steve Brown, a spokesman for Democratic House Speaker Michael Madigan, gave no time frame on possible House votes, though some House Democrats posted on their social media accounts that voting would take place on Thursday. “We’re still assessing when the best day will be for the people who supported passage of the legislation to return and deal with the veto message,” Brown said in an interview.  In an action-packed Fourth of July holiday session, the Democratic-led Senate gave final legislative approval to a $36 billion fiscal 2018 budget and $5 billion tax increase package passed by the House Sunday and Monday.  Within hours, Governor Bruce Rauner vetoed the trio of budget and revenue measures. The Senate then quickly overrode the vetoes, moving the final override to enact the bills over the governor’s vetoes to the House.  A stalemate between Rauner and Democrats who control the legislature has left the nation’s fifth-largest state without a complete budget for two fiscal years. While fiscal 2018 began on Saturday, lawmakers have been scrambling to piece together a spending and revenue plan to avoid Illinois becoming the first-ever U.S. state whose credit is rated junk. Ted Hampton, an analyst at Moody’s Investors Service, which rates Illinois at Baa3, one notch above junk, said on Tuesday a continuation of the state’s budget impasse would not bode well from a credit standpoint. “That’s going to be a negative for the state’s credit position not reflected in its (current) rating,” he said. In his veto message, the governor lashed out at lawmakers for passing budget measures that he said would make Illinois’ fiscal woes worse. “The package of legislation fails to address Illinois’ fiscal and economic crisis – and in fact, makes it worse in the long run. It does not balance the budget. It does not make nearly sufficient spending reductions, does not pay down our debt, and holds schools hostage to force a Chicago bailout,” Rauner said. The House on Tuesday adjourned until Wednesday without taking action on the override resolutions, a result of diminished ranks on a national holiday. Only 54 of the chamber’s 118 members were present on Tuesday afternoon - too few to conduct business under House rules. Among the missing were five of 15 House Republicans who had been vital for the tax increase piece of the budget package to pass on Saturday with 73 votes. Seventy-one votes are necessary to block Rauner’s vetoes. The House speaker’s spokesman, Brown, said he did not foresee any danger that previous votes in support of the budget - including from the 15 Republicans - would flip toward the governor, endangering the override push.

"Rubio warms to Trump, but won't be his vice president. WASHINGTON - Former U.S. Republican presidential candidate Marco Rubio on Sunday ruled out becoming Donald Trump’s vice presidential running mate, but said he’d be “honored” to play some kind of a role in helping him win the White House. Rubio, who clashed bitterly with Trump in the brutal race for the Republican nomination, said his policy differences with the real estate mogul were too great for Rubio to join the ticket. “I wouldn’t be the right choice for him,” Rubio said in an extensive interview with CNN’s “State of the Union” program. “Donald deserves to have a vice president - he’s earned the nomination - and he deserves to have a running mate that more fully embraces some of the things he stands for.” Rubio, a U.S. senator from Florida, ended his White House bid in March after an embarrassing loss in his home state. Trump, who has practically ensured he will emerge as the nominee from the Republican convention in July, derided Rubio as a lightweight and dubbed him “Little Marco.”  Rubio called the real estate mogul a con artist and quipped about his small hands, a charge that Trump took to mean as questioning the size of his manhood. Rubio and Trump differed sharply on policy issues, with Trump eschewing the interventionist approach favored by Rubio and Rubio criticizing Trump’s call for temporarily banning the entry of Muslims into the United States. Ahead of the July 18-21 Republican convention, Trump has sought to unify the party behind him and gain the backing of other prominent party figures. Rubio said he expected to attend the convention and did not rule out a speaking role. He said he wanted to be helpful to Trump’s presidential run because he wants to see likely Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton defeated in the Nov. 8 U.S. election. “I don’t want Hillary Clinton to be president. If there’s something I can do to help that from happening and it’s helpful to the cause I’d most certainly be honored to be considered for that,” Rubio said. In another olive branch to Trump, Rubio said he regretted making the “small hands” remark about his former foe. “I actually told Donald at one of the debates. I forget which one - I apologized to him for that,” Rubio said. “I said ‘I’m sorry that I said that.’ It’s not who I am. And I shouldn’t have done it.” ",0,en
"Turkey's Erdogan angers critics with plan to replace culture center. ISTANBUL (Reuters) - President Tayyip Erdogan announced on Monday plans to demolish a culture center in Istanbul named after the founder of modern secular Turkey, in a move critics see as another attempt by the Islamist-rooted ruling party to roll back secularism. It marks Erdogan s second attempt to tear down the Ataturk Culture Centre (AKM), named after Mustafa Kemal Ataturk, after a previous plan to develop the site near Taksim Square in 2013 erupted into mass protests against Turkey s ruling AK Party. The project envisages building an opera house, theater hall, a conference center and cinema on the site, near Gezi Park, the epicenter of the 2013 protests. Four years ago Erdogan had wanted to build a replica Ottoman baracks at the site.  Today Turkey is starting something it should have done 10 years ago,  Erdogan said at a ceremony where he announced the project. He said the new building would be a  new and bigger  opera house, referring to it as  the New AKM Project . Erdogan, who served as mayor of Istanbul in the 1990s, has long argued for the need to replace the AKM, saying the building is not resistant to earthquakes. The AKM has been closed to the public for the past 10 years over disagreements regarding its renovation and infrastructure. Opponents, however, see the planned demolition as further proof that Erdogan, a pious Muslim, and his AK Party want to reverse the secular order established by Ataturk in the 1920s and to reduce the use of the state founder s name and image in public life. Turkey s chamber of architects said in a statement on Friday that demolishing the AKM was  a crime  and a violation of the constitution.  The countless warnings and criminal complaints we have filed to public offices over the years have not been processed and the law has been disregarded, the AKM has been intentionally abandoned to demolition,  the chamber said.  We are warning once again: For years, there have been willing crimes committed against history, culture, arts, society and the people in front of the eyes of the world,  it said, without elaborating. The new project, whose cost has not been disclosed, will increase the capacity of the building from 1,300 people to 2,500 people, the presidency said in a statement.  Separately, Erdogan said the project would also pave the way to pedestrianising Taksim Square, one of the busiest hubs in Istanbul. ",0,en

"Factbox: Malaysia 2018 budget seen lifting cash aid, making GST change. KUALA LUMPUR (Reuters) - Malaysia s Prime Minister Najib Razak presents the government s 2018 budget on Oct. 27. Below are some items that it could feature, according to analysts  research notes and Malaysian media reports. OCBC Bank expects another year of cash handouts, estimating that the allocation will rise to 7.5 billion ringgit ($1.78 billion) from the 6.8 billion ringgit spent in 2017. The government may consider expanding the scope of the goods and services tax, which was introduced at 6 percent in April 2015, to cover e-commerce transactions, according to a note by UOB. Middle income earners could get tax breaks as Najib looks to soften the blow from rising living costs, according to Nomura economist Brian Tan. The last time the government announced tax cuts was 2014. Najib has said that civil servants can expect  good news  in the 2018 budget. Salaries were last raised between 7 and 13 percent in 2012, and in July 2016 the minimum wage was raised from 832 ringgit to 1,200 ringgit, according to data from HSBC. The government announced in April that minimum wage will be reviewed for a possible adjustment in 2018. The current rate is 1,000 ringgit in the peninsula and 920 ringgit in Sabah and Sarawak. The government is expected to raise its allocation to develop affordable housing for 2018. In this year s budget, 700 million ringgit was allocated to build affordable options such as Rent-To-Own schemes offering properties for as low as 35,000 ringgit to low-income earners. ",0,en
" BREAKING: WikiLeaks’ Big Anti-Hillary October Surprise CANCELLED. There s something about Donald Trump and his surrogates. They threaten information that s bound to doom their opponents and then, nothing.Perhaps the most obvious example was when Donald Trump insisted that he sent investigators to Hawaii to examine President Obama s birth certificate. He promised that his investigators  cannot believe what they re finding. Apparently, they couldn t believe what they found because it was literally nothing. Barack Obama was born in Hawaii and Trump s promise of a surprise never panned out.Now we have tacit Trump surrogate Julian Assange making promises of emails that will destroy Hillary Clinton. This was supposed to happen before the debate last Monday night. It didn t. Then, he promised that the emails would be released next week. They won t be. He s blaming  security. Due to security concerns at the Ecuadorian Embassy, Julian Assange s balcony announcement on Tues has been cancelled, per @wikileaks  Jesse Rodriguez (@JesseRodriguez) September 30, 2016The Trump campaign is probably reeling. Roger Stone, the CNN pundit, who, until just last week, was double dipping on Trump s payroll as well, tweeted this on Saturday:[email protected] is done. #Wikileaks.  Roger Stone (@RogerJStoneJr) October 2, 2016Perhaps the security concerns are real or perhaps they re not. Still, as someone on Twitter pointed out, Assange has other platforms, like video. Why does he need that particular balcony to make his big, oh so damning announcement?@JesseRodriguez @wikileaks okay, I can understand the balcony announcement being cancelled but will Julian make a video/news announcement?  Susan Reaney (@SSReaney) October 2, 2016So far, Assange s leaks have been pretty weak. The most damaging was during the primaries when he released emails damning to the DNC head, Debbie Wasserman Schultz who trash talked Bernie Sanders. Yes, there were a lot of problems with this leak, and yes, Schultz did deserve to lose her job, but there was no evidence of any actual wrongdoing. It just looked bad.While the DNC leaks showed that they were likely colluding with Hillary Clinton, Assange s motives are much more suspect. It s likely that Russia is behind the hacking, which would mean that Trump is being assisted, in a scenario that would have made even Richard Nixon say  whoa,  by foreign nationals. Trump even asked Russia to hack Clinton. That may be treason.Featured image via Carl Court/Getty Images.",1,en

Trudeau repeatedly downplayed the emails and said the department is  regularly in touch  with a wide range of people.One reporter pointed out that Clinton had  made a pledge  not to involve herself with the foundation while she was Secretary of State. Trudeau shot back that the agreement did not preclude others from talking to foundation staff.At one point, as another reporter the AP s Matt Lee was getting frustrated with the lack of answers, he said this: I m sorry, are you   am I not speaking English? Is this   I mean, is it coming across as a foreign   I m not asking you if   no one is saying it s not okay or it s bad for the department to get a broad variety of input from different people.

" Comedy Central’s Roast Of Rob Lowe HIJACKED As Comedians EPICALLY Roast Ann Coulter. Comedy Central s roasts of various celebrities are well known by this point, and it s just as well known is that the roasts almost never focus exclusively on the person being roasted. This year s roast is all about Rob Lowe, and the roasters do go after him quite heartily and gleefully. However, it seems that Ann Coulter is also inexplicably a roaster this year, and the other roasters decided to burn her about as bad as they did Rob Lowe.Coulter is a Trump fangirl. She s also just about the most racist and hateful public figure in all of existence. She takes all of Trump s bizarre rhetoric 700 steps farther than it needs to go, while calling him out for not going far enough. These comedians don t really seem to like her all that much, and neither did the audience. They actually booed her for using her appearance there to promote her most recent book,  In Trump We Trust.  Oh, please.Variety did us all a favor and captured the following zingers delivered at Coulter s expense:Nikki Glaser:  The only person you will ever make happy is the Mexican who digs your grave. Peyton Manning:  I m not the only athlete up here. As you know, earlier this year, Ann Coulter won the Kentucky Derby. Davidson:  If you are here, Ann, who is scaring the crows away from our crops? Lowe:  After seeing your set tonight, we ve seen the first bombing you can t blame on a Muslim. Jeff Ross:  Ann is against gay marriage. What is your thinking on that? If I can t get a husband, they can t either? Jewel:  I do want to say as a feminist that I can t support everything that s been said tonight. But as someone who hates Ann Coulter, I m delighted. Rob Riggle:  If Ann Coulter is here, someone must have said her name three times. Beetlejuice! Beetlejuice! Beetlejuice! And perhaps the harshest, from Jimmy Carr:  Ann is one of the most repugnant, hateful, hatchet-face bitches alive. It s not too late to change, Ann. You could kill yourself. Coulter herself tried to play comedian, too, and threw out this, ahem, gem, which was probably the only  gem  she uttered all night: I want to welcome everybody to the Ann Coulter roast with Rob Lowe. That s about the only thing she s ever gotten even close to right, even if she did solidify the idea that this roast is all about her. Everything she thinks is twisted, bigoted, false, and delusional. As the old clich  goes, even a stopped clock is right twice a day. Coulter, however, is right considerably less frequently than that.These are just a few of the jokes various Rob Lowe roasters shot her way, despite the fact that she was likewise a roaster, but has no connection to Lowe. Lowe explained her appearance by saying that they need all flavors at these roasts in order to make them work, and that s why she was there.Whatever the reason, though, Variety insinuates that her entire performance fell far more flat than anybody else s. Poor, poor Ann. Our hearts bleed for her and how stupid she ll look on Labor Day, which is when this will air.Featured image by Christopher Polk/Getty Images",1,en

"OOPS! HILLARY’S HIT WOMAN LIED About Trump Groping Her…Eye-Witness Comes Forward: “It was she that was the one being flirtatious”. It should be the lead story on every network, but you ll likely only see it in a few places. It doesn t change the fact however, that an eye-witness has come forward to say the woman accusing Trump of sexual assault on the plane, was actually pursuing him Donald Trump s campaign says a British man is countering claims that the GOP presidential nominee groped a woman on a cross-country flight more than three decades ago.The man says he was sitting across from the accuser and contacted the Trump campaign because he was incensed by her account   which is at odds with what he witnessed. I have only met this accuser once and frankly cannot imagine why she is seeking to make out that Trump made sexual advances on her. Not only did he not do so (and I was present at all times) but it was she that was the one being flirtatious,  Anthony Gilberthorpe said in a note provided to The Post by the Trump campaign.In an exclusive interview arranged by the campaign, Gilberthorpe said he was on the flight   in either 1980 or 1981  where Jessica Leeds claimed Trump groped her.Gilberthorpe, 54, said he was sitting across the first class aisle from the couple and saw nothing inappropriate. Leeds was wearing a white pantsuit, he said, while Trump was wearing a suit and cuff-links, which he gave to his British flight companion.Indeed, Gilberthorpe claimed, Leeds was  trying too hard  in her attempt to win Trump over. She wanted to marry him,  Gilberthorpe said of Leeds, who apparently made the confession when Trump excused himself and went to the bathroom.There was no kissing, but the  shrill  Leeds was  very much in your face  with the real estate developer.Gilberthorpe made headlines in 2014, when he went public with a claim that as a 17-year-old he procured boys (some who  could have been  underage ) for sex parties with high-ranking British politicians.Gilberthorpe has no evidence to back up his claim   just his self-described excellent memory. What she said about Trump is wrong,  he told The Post.  I mean, no decent human being could sit by and have a woman go on television and tell the United States of America   accuse an individual of sexually molesting. It s wrong for Trump, it s wrong for me. But you know something else? It s wrong for the American people,  he said.Leeds alleged this week in interviews with The New York Times and CNN that Trump groped her, touching her  wherever he could find a landing spot. The guy in the seat across the aisle could see. And I kept thinking, maybe the stewardess is going to come and he ll stop, but she never came,  Leeds told CNN.That allegation infuriated Gilberthorpe, a retiree living in northwest England, who said,  That I sat there   eyes bulging   and not intervening is nonsense. If there s evidence Trump s done it, sure, hang him from the post, but I was there, I was in a position to know that what she said was wrong, wrong, wrong,  he said.He immediately recognized Leeds when he saw video of her in The Times earlier this week holding up a younger picture of herself. Undoubtedly it was her,  he said.  I have a good photographic memory. I recognized her. He said he contacted the Trump campaign because he didn t like that Leeds said that another passenger sat by while she was molested. Via: NYP ",1,en

"Maine governor's outburst tests limits of anger politics.  (Editor’s note: This story contains language that may offend readers in the fourth paragraph) By Scott Malone BOSTON (Reuters) - Years before Donald Trump dominated the news cycle with his style of angry politics, Maine Governor Paul LePage made headlines with a similarly brash approach. Since he was elected in 2010, the Republican has told critics of his decision to skip a civil rights breakfast to “kiss my butt” and accused a Democratic rival of forcing budget measures on taxpayers “without Vaseline.” But when LePage, the second U.S. governor to endorse Trump, recently left an obscenity-laced voicemail message for a lawmaker who he believed had called him a racist, he put his career in jeopardy. LePage’s widely circulated verbal attack, in which he called Democratic State Representative Drew Gattine a “little son-of-a-bitch, socialist cocksucker,” sparked the most intense firestorm of criticism the second-term governor has seen. Even legislative leaders from his own party called him into a closed-door meeting to discuss his future. The reaction shows that not all politicians can get away with the kind of bellicose approach that helped Trump wipe out his primary rivals and win the support of angry voters who feel U.S. politicians do not care about their problems. “Trump is a master of media and LePage is not. They are very different at the end of the day,” said Michael Franz, chairman of the government and legal studies department at Maine’s Bowdoin College. “Trump says he hates the media, but he works it very well. LePage just hates it.” The governor infamously joked in 2013 that he would like to blow up the offices of the Portland Press Herald newspaper, which he felt treated him unfairly. On Wednesday, LePage told reporters he had met with Gattine and apologized, and that he had no plans to resign from office. Asked what might change about his governing style, LePage responded that he would no longer speak with reporters. “I will no longer speak to the press ever again after today,” LePage said. “I’m serious. Everything will be put in writing. I am tired of being caught, the gotcha moments.” That came a day after LePage openly discussed the idea of stepping down in a regular monthly interview with a Maine radio station. He later backed away from his comments, and paraphrasing Mark Twain, said in a Twitter post, “The reports of my political demise are greatly exaggerated.” LePage endorsed Trump’s run in February, shortly after New Jersey Governor Chris Christie did.  “I was Donald Trump before Donald Trump became popular,” LePage said at the time, saying that the wealthy New York businessman and reality TV star “could be one of the greatest presidents if he sits down and puts together a good team.” Trump has also praised LePage, saying that he would offer him a role in his administration “if he were available.” Both men describe their political styles as authentic and off-the-cuff and accuse more measured rivals of being career politicians who are out of touch with the needs of average voters. LePage’s brusqueness played well in Maine until recently. He won re-election in a three-way 2014 race with the support of 48 percent of voters with a wider margin of victory than the 38 percent he garnered in his first run, also a three-way race. Neil Levesque, executive director of the New Hampshire Institute of Politics said that success, coupled with Trump’s rise, could have emboldened LePage to double down on attack politics. “Almost anything goes now. You can call your opponents almost anything, you can threaten them,” Levesque said. “This is the new norm in American politics.” ",0,en
" A Trump Fanboy Just BLASTED Trump’s Tweeting: ‘It Makes You Wonder What Else He’s Doing’. It s expected that Trump s critics would get on his case for lying about massive election/voter fraud   there s simply no evidence of it. One might expect even the most supportive Republicans to jump on him for that too, since they re all about upholding our democracy, and making claims of massive fraud in an election undermines public confidence in democracy. They re suspiciously silent, though, except for a few.Surprisingly, one of those few is one of Trump s biggest fanboys, Newt Gingrich. He s spoken out against Trump before, sure, but not very often, not very loudly, and not like this: The president of the United States can t randomly tweet without having somebody check it out, It makes you wonder about whatever else he s doing. It undermines much more than just a single tweet. So I d say that s probably the biggest single thing he s done wrong.  [emphasis mine]No, we re not fans of Newt Gingrich, but we are fans of this because he s right: It does make you wonder what Trump is doing that none of us can see. What he s cooking up behind the scenes. How he really sees the world, which has been a point of endless speculation. Things of that nature.Nobody else put it this way, though. Other critics were more conventional in their criticism of Trump s tweet about election fraud. They re saying he needs evidence before making that claim, which is also true. Lindsey Graham, one of Trump s most vocal and vicious critics despite also being a Republican, blasted the specific nature of that tweet: You are now the president-elect of the United States. If you really believe that millions of people voted illegally, you should have some proof. Because your voice is not just an ordinary voice. However, others, including John McCain, just said they weren t going to weigh in on this. John Cornyn of Texas even said he s got bigger things to worry about, and from his point of view, that very well may be true. However, it s important to note that Trump actively undermined the people s faith in democracy all through his campaign by crying that everything was rigged against him.In doing that, he made us vulnerable to becoming a dictatorship, the one thing Republicans seem to fear the most. That s what makes this important.Now that he s won, none of that none of the recount efforts, nor the popular vote should matter much to him. But there he is, on Twitter, bitching up a dark, smelly cloud about election fraud to try and bolster his own political legitimacy when it all should be tiny potatoes to him now. That can be a characteristic of an autocrat.Gingrich believes Trump shouldn t stop tweeting, but should put someone between him and his Twitter account to avoid things like this. That s to be expected   no matter what Trump does, Gingrich is still totally and blindly enamored of him (and it s getting kinda creepy, actually). But to speak to the national press, and say openly and publicly that Trump is actively working to destroy America s (ahem) confidence in him, is pretty huge for a fanboy.Featured image by Drew Angerer via Getty Images",1,en
"JUST IN: THREE LIBERAL REPORTERS Bribed To Push “Trump Dossier” Propaganda.  It s no wonder that Fusion GPS wants to block documents from coming out. The newest unsealed documents are explosive enough with the revelation that there was a payoff to three reporters to push negative news on Trump. Who are the three journalists? Well, Fusion GPS wants that to remain a secret Unsealed court documents reveal that the firm behind the salacious 34-page Trump-Russia Dossier, Fusion GPS, was paid $523,000 by a Russian businessman convicted of tax fraud and money laundering, whose lawyer, Natalia Veselnitskaya, was a key figure in the infamous June 2016 meeting at Trump Tower arranged by Fusion GPS associate Rob Goldstone.In short, D.C. opposition research firm Fusion GPS is the common denominator linked to two schemes used to damage the Trump campaign.PAYOFF TO THREE JOURNALISTS:Newly filed court documents confirm that Fusion GPS, the company mostly responsible for the controversial  Trump dossier  on presidential candidate Donald Trump, made payments to three journalists between June 2016 until February 2017.The revelation could be a breakthrough for House Republicans, who are exploring whether Fusion GPS used the dossier, which was later criticized for having inaccurate information on Trump, to feed anti-Trump stories to the press during and after the presidential campaign. The three journalists who were paid by Fusion GPS are known to have reported on  Russia issues relevant to [the committee s] investigation,  the House Intelligence Committee said in a court filing.REDACTED DOCUMENTS AND RESTRAINING ORDERS:But the recipients  names, the amounts, and purposes of those payments were either redacted from the documents that Fusion GPS filed to the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia or were not disclosed.Fusion has asked the court to issue a restraining order against the House committee, which is demanding documents from the company that, among other things, explain the payments it made to reporters. Most of the documents sought are banking records.Let s hope that the details come to light and all are held accountable for their corruption.",1,en

"GQ Magazine Pens Repulsive Article On Brilliant Neurosurgeon: “F*CK Ben Carson”. How would have America reacted if this article was written by GQ Magazine during Barack Hussein Obama s run for President in 2008? Where is the cry of  racism  from the right for calling one of the most brilliant pediatric neurosurgeons in history  stupid.  The double standards and clear hypocrisy of the so called  media  that American consumers support when they purchase this trash is outrageous! The real problem with the Left is that they just can t get their little minds around the fact that Dr. Ben Carson would suggest he would be willing to risk his own life for the sake of saving several others. The wussification of America is happening at warp speed and unless every day Americans are willing to stand up to these freaks, we are going to lose our country. Screen grab of article published in GQ Magazine.Here is a portion of the repulsive article written by GQ:You know, the only thing more alarming than Donald Trump leading the Republican presidential field is the fact that Ben Carson is the guy right behind him. While establishment puds like Jeb! Bush and Marco Rubio can t decide if they want to beat Trump or emulate him, the Good Doctor made it clear this week that he is not only willing to replicate Trump s signature brand of hot-garbage-spewing, but he ll say even DUMBER shit. Here is Carson from earlier in the week on the Oregon shooter: Not only would I probably not cooperate with him, I would not just stand there and let him shoot me. I would say,  Hey, guys, everybody attack him. He may shoot me, but he can t get us all.   Oh, but he wasn t done yet. Carson knows a goldmine of asinine cannon fire when he sees it, so he went in again: I never saw a body with bullet holes that was more devastating than taking the right to arm ourselves away. And again: I have had a gun held on me when I was in a Popeyes organization. Guy comes in, put the gun in my ribs. And I just said,  I believe that you want the guy behind the counter.   That s right, Carson just threw the poor cashier right under the bus. Whatever happened to having everyone attack the gunman, Doctor? Does that strategy get tossed out the window when there s a convenient low-level cashier around to take the brunt of the crossfire?Here s the thing: I don t believe Carson when he says any of this. I bet he wasn t even held up at that chicken joint. Carson is a soft-spoken fella who knows that he has to make even sillier comments than the competition just so that his silly comments are heard. You saw Bobby Jindal do the same thing this week when he called out the Oregon shooter s father as the main culprit in the massacre.You are now bearing witness to an arms race of stupid, because stupid is in such high demand from the GOP base at the present moment. Stupid is what gets you attention, and attention is what gets you better polling numbers.Wow just wow!!For entire story: GQ",1,en

"Malta court hears blogger bomb probably triggered from boat at sea. VALLETTA (Reuters) - The bomb used to kill Maltese anti-corruption blogger Daphne Caruana Galizia was probably triggered by a call from a boat off Malta, an investigator said on Tuesday, laying out initial evidence against three suspects. Caruana Galizia died in the powerful blast as she was driving near her home in the village of Bidnija on Oct. 16   a killing that appalled Europe and raised questions about the rule of law on the tiny Mediterranean island. Brothers Alfred and George Degiorgio, and Vince Muscat were arrested earlier this month in connection with the murder. The three men, who were known to police, have denied any wrongdoing. Police started laying out their evidence against the trio to a Malta court which will decide whether to order a trial. One of the chief investigators, Keith Arnaud, described how a team from the U.S. Federal Bureau of Investigation, brought in by the Malta government to help solve the crime, had focused on a phone number which received a text message at the time of the explosion in Bidnija. Police say the number was not attached to a mobile phone but to a circuit board used in remote-control devices. The appliance was switched on at 2 a.m. local time in Bidnija on the day of the explosion and went off the grid at the time of the blast.  Part of the circuit board was later found in the wreckage of the car. Cell phone data suggested the device was triggered by a call from off the coast. CCTV video showed a boat owned by the Degiorgio brothers putting to sea at around 8 a.m. on the day of the killing. It was later seen still at sea at 2.50 p.m. and was idling at the time of the explosion before returning to harbor.  The three suspects had never been the target of any of Caruana Galizia s often fierce blogs, leading to questions over their possible motive. The blogger s family say the people who ordered the killing remain at large. Arnaud revealed that police had already been tapping the phone of George Degiorgio at the time of the murder and had heard him asking two separate people to top up the credit of a mobile phone number on the morning of the blast. He did not go into further details, but local media have reported that the same number might have triggered the bomb. Arnaud was the first person called to testify in the pre-trial hearing, which has been delayed twice over the past week after the initial two magistrates assigned to the case recused themselves. A third magistrate, Claire Stafrace Zammit, rejected calls by the defense for her also to abstain from the case because Caruana Galizia had once praised her husband. She dismissed the request as frivolous. The hearing will resume on Wednesday. ",0,en
" Congressional Black Caucus Condemns Trump: He’s A Racist Who Cozies Up To White Supremacists. Democratic members of the Congressional Black Caucus (CBC) condemned Donald Trump and his unbelievably tone-deaf attempt at African-American  outreach,  slamming him as a racist who has spent his entire campaign cozying up to white supremacists.The CBC convened a conference call on Tuesday to denounce Trump, and accused his campaign of not only perpetuating stereotypes but also deliberately dog whistling to white supremacists in an effort to turn their bigotry into votes.Rep. Gregory Meeks (D-N.Y.) said that the Republican nominee is  one of the most racist, sexist and bigoted candidates  to launch a bid for the White House in modern history, and accused Trump of having a  kinship with white supremacists. He knows the audience he s trying to reach out to and it s not African-Americans,  Meeks said.  He s trying to appeal to David Duke and the racists of the world with what they think are stereotypes.   He s trying to appeal to the worst of the white supremacists and others he s been catering to in the campaign to try and help them with turnout. In the past few days, Trump has attempted to pander to minority voters but has done an exceedingly poor job of it. In an effort to garner votes from African-Americans he claimed that their communities are  war zones  and that they live in fear of being shot at any moment. Trump s big selling point was that since black Americans live in poverty, have poor education, and a lack of job opportunities they might as well vote for him. After all, it isn t like they have anything to lose, right?Trump s blatant racism and p*ss poor excuse for minority outreach aren t going over well with African-American voters or lawmakers.CBC Chairman G.K. Butterfield (D-N.C.) blasted Trump for giving speeches supposedly meant to draw black voters to crowds that are overwhelmingly white and said that the GOP nominee s so-called outreach is  a slap in the face  to the African-American community. If Donald Trump truly cared about African-Americans, he d disavow his long history of hateful and racist attacks against our community, he d apologize for having discriminated against black families   he d disavow his support for white supremacists and white supremacy,  Butterfield said.The Democrats taking part in Tuesday s call ripped Trump s past history of discriminatory housing practices during his years as a real estate investor and his habit of exploiting minority workers as a builder.They noted that his campaign has been littered with bigotry from the very beginning when he announced his candidacy by calling all Mexicans  rapists.  Since then, he has been reluctant to disavow the Ku Klux Klan and David Duke, called for all Muslims to be banned from entering the United States, accused a judge of being incapable of impartiality because of his Mexican heritage, and has refused to believe that President Obama was born in America.In response to Trump and his racist rhetoric, Democrats say they are pushing their minority voter registration efforts into overdrive and plan to set records with black and Hispanic turnout at the polls in November. To say that minority voters are eager to cast their ballots for Hillary Clinton to make sure that Trump never gets anywhere near the White House would be an understatement. Donald Trump is a voter registration machine and a citizenship-advocating engine,  said Rep. Luis Guti rrez (D-Ill.).  This is a little bit of thank you, because our community has never been so united or energized since that moment you set foot in national arena. Trump has said repeatedly that he will do great with African-Americans and Hispanics. It is hard to know what in the world ever gave him that idea, but his  outreach  isn t helping his cause and surely won t convince minority voters to turn a blind eye to the fact that he has built his entire campaign on bigotry.Featured image via Mark Wilson/Getty Images",1,en

" Watch A GOP Senate Candidate Threaten To Harm A Reporter (VIDEO). A Republican United States Senate candidate in Colorado was caught on video appearing to threaten a reporter with bodily harm. Jon Keyser was confronted by reporter Marshall Zelinger of Denver 7 at a fundraiser and asked questions about suspicious signatures on petitions Keyser had submitted in order to get on the ballot.After initially responding with talking points assuring that he would be on the ballot against Democratic Senator Michael Bennet, Keyser apparently recognized Zelinger for having recently knocked on his door in order to get a comment on the record from the candidate. That s when he relayed his threat.Keyser told Zelinger,  My dog is bigger than you are. He s huge. He s a big guy. Very protective.  Zelinger, obviously surprised by the statement, asked Keyser to clarify. In response, Keyser pointed out that his dog weighs 165 pounds.Watch the video of the tense and odd exchange here:https://www.facebook.com/MZ7NEWS/videos/1313426775337589/Keyser has been under fire because he initially failed to meet the standards for the 10,500 signatures needed to be listed on the ballot in Colorado   1,500 signatures in each of the state s 7 congressional districts. A news investigation also found that several of the signatures were apparently forged:Denver7 has talked to several people whose names appeared on petitions for Jon Keyser in the first congressional district who claim their signatures were forged.  Many of those signatures were collected by a woman named Maureen.A sympathetic judge overruled the Secretary of State s ruling keeping Keyser off the ballot, but now a progressive group in the state is petitioning for an investigation.ProgressNow Colorado sent a letter to Mitch Morrissey and Peter Weir, the District Attorneys in Denver and Jefferson County, respectively. We ask that you pursue a criminal investigation of Jon Keyser and his campaign immediately. Colorado voters must have full confidence in the integrity of the election process,  wrote ProgressNow Colorado Executive Director Alan Franklin.Under a cloud of suspicion like that, it certainly doesn t look good for Keyser to try to intimidate the press.Featured image via screen capture",1,en

" Twitter BLASTS Whole Foods For Yet Another Expensive, Unnecessary Product (TWEETS). Whole Foods is a store that many people love. They love the organic food, the appearance of cleanliness and health, and the impeccable customer service. However, lately, this popular chain has found itself under fire for creating and marketing products that are excessively expensive and completely unnecessary   often at the expense of the environment due to the packaging, and at the expense of its customers  budgets.Everyone remembers the absolute shitstorm caused by the asparagus water last year that the chain sold   $6 a bottle for water with a couple of stalks of asparagus in it. Apparently, that did not teach the folks at Whole Foods a lesson, because they have now just had a similar reaction to another ridiculously expensive product   oranges that are already peeled, which are going for a whopping $6 a pound.Needless to say, the public has not taken kindly to this move, and many people have taken to Twitter to blast the chain. Here are just a few choice critical tweets:Firstly, it was pointed out how environmentally irresponsible this is:If only nature would find a way to cover these oranges so we didn't need to waste so much plastic on them. pic.twitter.com/00YECaHB4D  Nathalie Gordon (@awlilnatty) March 3, 2016 @awlilnatty Fucking hell. That makes me unbelievably angry actually. Talk about necessarily contributing to plastic taking over the planet.  Swiftie Be (@StephanieBe) March 3, 2016Others pointed out how ironic the chain s antics are, given its name:@ajdomanico @awlilnatty the irony of this being Whole Foods too  Mollie Goodfellow (@hansmollman) March 3, 2016Others made fun of the obviously lazy nature of the people who would purchase this:@ConorS @awlilnatty @MisterVivian next logical step: half eaten.    (@Jemppu) March 4, 2016It was pointed out that it could be ableist to assume that everyone can peel an orange; however, that point was quickly followed by the obvious fact that such people are not who Whole Foods is targeting. In fact, due to the fact that most disabled people are not exactly well-to-do, they likely could never even afford to shop at Whole Foods, making that particular point moot:@otherbecky @awlilnatty You know, as well as i do, that that is NOT who that is marketed towards. Also, the packaging is still superfluous.  Swiftie Be (@StephanieBe) March 4, 2016All of this and more is true here. This is simply outrageous. Shame on you, Whole Foods. You market to organic food-eating, hippieish, health conscious liberals, and you expect us to put up with this, to not notice? Well, for the second time in their price-gouging attempt, Whole Foods was forced to backtrack, calling the marketing and selling of these pre-peeled oranges a  mistake. @awlilnatty Definitely our mistake. These have been pulled. We hear you, and we will leave them in their natural packaging: the peel.  Whole Foods Market (@WholeFoods) March 3, 2016You re damn right it was a mistake.

"U.S. judge orders Trump administration to allow entry to immigrant visa holders. LOS ANGELES/NEW YORK (Reuters) - A federal judge in Los Angeles has ruled President Donald Trump’s administration must allow immigrants with initial clearance for legal residency to enter the United States from seven Muslim-majority nations, despite an executive order ban. Tuesday’s ruling by U.S. District Judge Andre Birotte Jr follows decisions by federal judges in at least four other states that also limited the executive order Trump issued on Friday.  But it goes further, by focusing on a large group of people from the seven nations of Iran, Iraq, Libya, Somalia, Sudan, Syria and Yemen - the countries targeted in the executive order - who are outside the United States and trying to enter.  In the temporary ruling, Birotte ordered U.S. officials to refrain from “removing, detaining or blocking the entry of plaintiffs or any other person ... with a valid immigrant visa” who is arriving from one of the seven nations.   According to the U.S. Department of State, immigrant visas are the first step to becoming a lawful permanent resident, or a green card holder. Birotte’s ruling does not apply to tourists, students or business travelers with non-immigrant visas. The U.S. Department of Justice is reviewing the order and would have no further comment, a spokeswoman for the agency said in an email.  A spokeswoman for the Department of Homeland Security cited its policy of not commenting on pending litigation.  Trump’s executive order has not only caused consternation for the nations involved but among other Muslim-majority countries, allies such as Germany and Britain and career State Department officials. Attorney Julie Ann Goldberg, who brought the case on behalf of more than two dozen plaintiffs of Yemeni descent, including U.S. citizens, said they sought the ruling after learning of a move by the U.S. State Department to cancel the immigrant visas of people from the seven countries. More than 200 people with immigrant visas who left Yemen and are related to U.S. citizens or legal residents are stranded in Djibouti across the Bab el-Mandeb Strait from Yemen and were barred from flying to the United States, Goldberg said by telephone from Djibouti. “It’s terrible because I have children here who are without their parents,” she said.  Some other children in the group are U.S. citizens whose parents were traveling with immigrant visas, she added. In Boston, U.S. District Judge Allison Burroughs on Sunday issued a ruling, to last seven days, that barred the detention and removal of approved refugees, visa holders and permanent U.S. residents who entered from the seven countries. By early Thursday in Djibouti, Goldberg said, no one from the group she represented was being allowed to leave for the United States. She accused the Trump administration of “absolutely ignoring” rulings she believes should allow their departure. In an email, a State Department official confirmed the agency had provisionally revoked “relevant visas as defined” under Trump’s executive order.  The White House said on Wednesday it has issued updated guidance on the order clarifying that green card holders require no waiver to enter the United States. ",0,en

"Catalan govt to blame for companies' exodus from region: Spanish finance minister. LUXEMBOURG (Reuters) - Spain s finance minister on Monday blamed the Catalan government for companies moving their headquarters out of the region, while his euro zone colleagues played down the impact of the Spanish crisis on the shared currency. In recent weeks, a stream of Catalonia-based firms and banks have moved their legal bases outside the regionas a crisis over a Catalonian push for independence from Spain deepened. Caixabank, Spain s number 3 bank, and Banco Sabadell, the number 5, have both moved their head offices out of Catalonia last week following an independence  referendum that the Madrid government attempted to block.  The exit of many companies from Catalonia is the consequence of the irrational and radical policies implemented and pursued by the (regional) government,  minister Luis de Guindos said as he arrived for a meeting of euro zone finance ministers in Luxembourg.  Losing Catalonia would have a significant impact on Spain, as the region makes up a fifth of the country s economic output and more than a quarter of its exports. Some fear it will impact on the euro zone economy, which is slowly recovering from a recession at the start of the decade. Nevertheless, most euro zone ministers declined to get drawn into a discussion on the situation in Catalonia, with Eurogroup president Jeroen Dijsselbloem describing it as a  domestic issue .  I hope that those prevail in Spain, who understand that, as the Spanish Prime Minister has said, law and constitution are the basis on which we operate,  German Finance Minister Wolfgang Schaeuble said.  European Economics Commissioner Pierre Moscovici, asked about the economic impact of the Catalan debate, said the Spanish constitutional order must be respected.  This situation cannot be solved by violence, we have to find a solution through dialogue, this is also true when you consider the economic oint of view,  he said. Spain also sought to reassure international investors concerned about the political situation in the country.   The message is crystal clear: Catalonian independence is not going to happen,  De Guindos said. ",0,en

"[AUDIO] MARK LEVIN EXPLAINS HOW HILLARY REALLY COULD BE GOING TO PRISON For Violating Espionage Act – Section 793 Penal Code. Hillary in prison orange kinda like an early Christmas gift to America Section 793 of the Penal Code, subsection (f) is a problem for Hillary Clinton.

And there may be no other individual that best embodies the Clinton s web of influence   for good and bad   than Mr. Podesta.

"CONDOLEEZZA RICE BRILLIANTLY Shuts Down “The View” Dingbats Over Trump-Russia Collusion [VIDEO]. On more than one occasion, Condoleezza Rice was able correct the record by pointing out the hypocrisy of these ladies in such a way that they didn t even know it. It started with Trump-hater and ABC senior legal analyst Sunny Hostin asking about General Flynn s alleged discussions with Russia weeks before Trump s inauguration asking,  As someone who has had that position as national security advisor, would you have felt comfortable having those discussions, is that inappropriate?  Rice went on to explain how you will have conversations with foreigners, but the thing you shouldn t do is discuss policy. She then went on to say that,  There s only one president  and that as a matter of principle, you can talk to anybody in that period, but you should never suggest that you might be making changes in policy and maybe they should just wait until there s a change in administration. Was Rice referring to the time Obama was caught on a hot mic telling Russian President Dmitry Medvedev,  This is my last election, after the election, I ll have more flexibility ?While explaining how we should be handling Vladimir Putin s potential meddling in our elections, Rice reminded the panel that when Hillary was Secretary of State she questioned the legitimacy of Putin s election in 2012 and now he s saying,  I m going to question the legitimacy of your election . Rice s answer wasn t quite what The View hacks had hoped for, and like a dog on a bone, The View host Sunny Hostin continued,  But Madame Secretary, if he [Putin] indeed did engage in these kinds of tactics in the election, then the very legitimacy of our election is at issue isn t it? Rice snapped back,  No. Rice then went on to say,  I trust the people who voted in Wisconsin and Texas and Alabama and California to have voted on the basis of who they thought was best gonna represent their interests. So I m not gonna question the legitimacy of their vote because Vladimir Putin tried to interfere in the elections. That s just a step that I m don t think we should take. Let s trust our fellow citizens to have been smart enough to vote for the people they ought to be voting for.  ZING! WATCH:And for the final blow, fake conservative host Jedidiah Bilah  (who, let s face it, is really just collecting a paycheck because she s a token  conservative  who s too weak to stand up for anything) has the opportunity to defend conservatism in some way with one of the most brilliant female conservatives sitting on their panel and she used the opportunity to trash President Trump over his handling of N.

"Russia's Putin registers re-election bid. MOSCOW (Reuters) - President Vladimir Putin formally registered his re-election bid on Wednesday, submitting the necessary documents to Russia s central election commission in person ahead of a March 18 vote.  Polls show that Putin, who has dominated Russia s political landscape for the last 17 years as either president or prime minister, is on course to comfortably win another six-year term. That would allow him to rule until 2024, when he ll turn 72. The former KGB officer is running as an independent, a move seen as a way of strengthening his image as a  father of the nation  rather than as a party political figure. The ruling United Russia party and the Just Russia party have both said they will support him. Allies laud Putin for restoring national pride and expanding Moscow s global clout with interventions in Syria and Ukraine. But opposition leader Alexei Navalny, who has been barred from the election over a suspended prison sentence he says was fabricated, says Putin has been in power too long and that his support is artificially maintained by a biased state media and an unfair system which excludes genuine opponents.  Navalny has called for a boycott of the election, raising the prospect of large-scale protests and clashes with the police. ",0,en

"House Democrats question if Valeant is withholding records. WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Democrats on a powerful U.S. congressional panel are questioning whether Canada-based Valeant Pharmaceuticals may be wrongfully withholding documents in connection with its ongoing probe into sky-rocketing drug prices, according to an internal memo seen by Reuters on Tuesday. The memo, which was sent to Democratic members of the House of Representatives Committee on Oversight and Government Reform from the staff of its top Democrat Elijah Cummings, reveals that Valeant previously withheld readily available analyst reports prepared by banks such as Goldman Sachs, saying they were protected by attorney-client privilege. The memo says it also raises questions about other documents that are still being withheld, saying some of these “were not drafted by attorneys and do not include communications with attorneys.” A spokeswoman for Valeant denied that the company has done anything wrong, saying it has already provided more than 78,000 pages of documents and will continue cooperating. “We continue to discuss with the committee the issue of privileged documents, but any suggestion that we have withheld documents inappropriately is incorrect,” Laurie Little said in a statement. The April 26 memo comes just one day before three of Valeant’s top executives are slated to appear before a different U.S. Senate panel that is also investigating high drug prices. The company’s outgoing CEO Michael Pearson will be testifying before the Senate Special Committee on Aging late Wednesday afternoon, along with activist investor William Ackman, a majority shareholder and board member, and Howard Schiller, a director and former chief financial officer. Their appearance before Congress comes at an awkward and difficult time for the company, which is under fire from its shareholders and facing a number of ongoing government investigations into drug pricing and distribution, accounting and disclosures, and antitrust matters. Last month, the company announced that Pearson would be stepping down and that Ackman would be joining its board, after a board committee probe into the company’s dealings with specialty pharmacy Philidor RX Services uncovered accounting problems dating back to December 2014. The company said it would restate its earnings and delay filing its annual report, opening the door to a possible default on its $30 billion debt. The company has blamed some of the accounting problems on Schiller, and asked him to step down from his board seat. Schiller has refused to do so, and has denied any wrongdoing through his attorney. Valeant plans to file its annual report on April 29, two days after the hearing. Wednesday’s hearing will be primarily focused on Valeant’s drastic price increases for two of its heart drugs. The committee previously planned to vote to hold Pearson in contempt for failing to be deposed, but backed down after he agreed to be interviewed April 18. ",0,en

"Iraq builds up forces south of Kurdish oil export pipeline: security sources. BAGHDAD (Reuters) - Iraqi forces are deploying tanks and artillery south of a Kurdish-held area of northern Iraq where a section of a Kurdish oil export pipeline is located, security sources said on Monday. The buildup is taking place northwest of Mosul, an official from the Kurdistan Regional Government s (KRG) security council said by phone from the Kurdish capital, Erbil.  An Iraqi government security advisor said the Fish-Khabur area, northwest of Mosul, is the location of crossings into Turkey and Syria that Baghdad wants to bring under its control. But he declined to say if a military move was being prepared.  A pipeline carrying crude across Iraqi Kurdistan connects to a metering station in Fish-Khabur before feeding another pipeline that takes the crude to the Turkish Mediterranean coast for exports. The military buildup is taking place around Rabi a, 40 kilometers (25 miles) south of the Fish-Khabur, the Kurdish security official said. Turkey and Iran both support measures taken by the Iraqi government to isolate the KRG after it held a referendum on Kurdish independence on Sept. 25 and to bring the Kurdistan region s oil exports and land crossings under Baghdad s authority.  Iraq has shown zero signs of de-escalating,  said a statement by the KRG Security Council about the deployment, adding that units being brought to the region include Iranian-backed Popular Mobilisation paramilitaries. The Fish-Khabur crossing has been under Kurdish control since 1991, when the United States and western powers imposed a no-fly zone over northern Iraq to protect the Kurds from Saddam Hussein s army. The Syrian side of the border in the region is now under the control of U.S.-backed Syrian Kurdish forces.  ",0,en

"Scottish government recommends rejection of EU withdrawal bill. EDINBURGH (Reuters) - Scotland s devolved government has recommended that its parliament at Holyrood withhold consent for legislation to withdraw Britain from the European Union, on the grounds that it could water down their powers, a document filed by the Scottish government said on Tuesday. The approval of the devolved parliaments in Scotland and Wales does not represent a veto to the Brexit process, although it would stretch Britain s constitutional tensions yet further by forcing the UK government of Prime Minister Theresa May to ignore the expressed wish of the devolved bodies. Scotland would work with the Welsh government to propose amendments to the bill which, if agreement were reached, would allow it to recommend its passage in the devolved assemblies, the document said. The bill will end the supremacy of EU law in the UK and convert all existing EU laws into domestic ones.  Along with the Welsh government, the Scottish government cannot recommend to the parliament that it gives consent to the bill as currently drafted,  the document filed with the Scottish parliament said.  The Scottish government is also clear that the result of withdrawal from the EU should not be centralization of power in Whitehall and Westminster. However, that is what the bill proposes.   Scotland s First Minister Nicola Sturgeon has been arguing that Brexit as proposed flies in the face of the devolution agreement, which up to now has allowed assemblies in Edinburgh, Cardiff and Belfast to legislate on their own domestic policies such as health and education. Scotland and Northern Ireland voted to keep EU membership in a June 2016 referendum while England and Wales voted to leave.  It remains a matter of regret to the Scottish government that the UK plans to withdraw from the EU. The government nevertheless accepts that preparations should be made for withdrawal from the EU, including preserving a functioning legal system,  the document said.  The Scottish government s key objections to the bill as introduced relate to the provisions on the competence of the Scottish parliament and government (...) and those on powers for UK and Scottish ministers to alter domestic law,  it said. The Scottish and Welsh governments argue that returning powers now exercised by the EU to the UK government will imply restrictions on the power of Scottish and Welsh chambers. But Britain s Scotland minister, David Mundell, has said that the repeal will ultimately result in a boost in devolved parliamentary power.     ",0,en

"Cuba, U.S. to discuss detente in wake of Trump election. HAVANA/WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Cuba and the United States will draw up a roadmap for deepening their detente on Wednesday in a first meeting since the election of Donald Trump as U.S. president and the death of Cuban revolutionary Fidel Castro. The fifth U.S.-Cuban bilateral commission comes at a time of increased uncertainty about the future of U.S.-Cuban relations given Trump’s promise to end the detente if Cuba did not offer a better “deal.” The administration of outgoing U.S. President Barack Obama has pressed American companies to complete additional business deals in Cuba to help further cement the president’s policy by the time Trump takes office on January 20. “We will define the actions that will be carried out in the coming weeks to further the process of improving relations,” the Cuban foreign ministry said on Tuesday. Those actions would include high-level visits and accords of cooperation in areas of mutual interest, it said. Communist-ruled Cuba has so far mostly stayed quiet on Trump’s statements, waiting to see whether he converts his tough rhetoric into policy change. Several major U.S. companies, such as General Electric, are in the final stages of negotiating deals with Cuba, sources familiar with the matter say. One of those sources, based in Washington, said more than half a dozen announcements, ranging from cruise ships and travel to manufacturing and telecommunications, are believed to be in the works. Negotiations may have been affected by the nine days of official mourning for Castro, the source said. Castro had given Cuba an outsized influence in world affairs during his half century as president, partly by clashing with the United States.  His younger brother, Raul Castro, who took over as president in 2008, made history two years ago by agreeing with Obama to end Cold War hostility and start normalizing relations.  Since then, the two countries have opened embassies, restored commercial flights, opened travel options and negotiated agreements on issues affecting the environment, law enforcement, the postal service and communications. Obama, who visited Cuba earlier this year, has also gradually poked holes in the U.S. embargo on the Caribbean island through executive orders. But Trump says Obama ought to have cut a “better deal.” At a campaign rally in Miami, which has a large population of Cuban exiles, he said he would seek to reverse Obama’s moves to open relations with Cuba unless its leaders allowed religious freedoms and freed political prisoners. U.S. supporters of the detente say it is improving Cubans’ lives while contributing to opening the socialist system in place, for example by fostering the fledgling private sector. A bipartisan group of U.S. congressional leaders and four Cuban entrepreneurs will hold a joint news conference on Wednesday to urge Congress to lift the U.S. embargo on Cuba. The Cuban entrepreneurs will also urge Trump not to reverse the thaw, according to a statement issued by the office of pro-detente Senator Patrick Leahy. ",0,en
"Mexico report flags shortcomings in fight against corruption. MEXICO CITY (Reuters) - The Mexican government has noted serious shortcomings in its fight against corruption in a classified report seen by Reuters, which was prepared ahead of an international evaluation of the country s efforts to combat money laundering. The undated government report estimated that the drug trade, tax fraud and other crimes were worth at least 1.13 trillion pesos ($58.5 billion) a year in Mexico, with all of that money susceptible to money laundering. In October last year the government published a much shorter official version of the findings, which broadly described the risks of money laundering without going into detail. The sum of illicit funds identified in the classified report was equivalent to 6.6 percent of the Mexican economy in 2014, when the data was compiled. It did not include an estimate of the value of corruption and several other crimes. The 321-page report was prepared ahead of an evaluation of the country s performance in preventing money laundering by the Financial Action Task Force (FATF), a global group of government agencies dedicated to tackling money laundering.  The view is that the risk represented by illicit funds susceptible to money laundering in Mexico generated within the jurisdiction is HIGH,  the report said, capitalizing the word. The government said on Thursday the FATF evaluation, which is not yet public, showed Mexico had made  significant  progress in combating money laundering since the last evaluation in 2008. The FATF did not immediately reply to a request for comment. The Mexican government report is the first of its kind, according to people familiar with it, and was assembled from official data and independent research. Part of a broader investigation into illicit wealth in Mexico, the government concluded that Mexico needed  more efficient mechanisms  to prevent graft, including new laws that would complement the national anti-corruption architecture. Reuters contacted the ministries of finance, economy and the interior, as well as the navy, the attorney general s office and the central bank, all of which were identified as contributors to the report. All either declined to comment or did not reply. The report urged the government to standardize laws at state level to iron out differences in how authorities deal with corruption, as well as improve collaboration between agencies tasked with implementing policy and collecting data. Public policies should be overhauled to  better understand the phenomenon of corruption in Mexico,  the report said. Graft scandals have for decades dogged the political elite in Mexico, which ranked 128th out of 137 nations for ethics and corruption in the World Economic Forum s 2017-2018 Global Competitiveness Index. President Enrique Pena Nieto has been criticized for referring to corruption as a  cultural  problem in Mexico. Civil society groups and opposition lawmakers said this downplayed the severity of the problem and the government s role in fixing it. In 2016, Mexicanos Contra la Corrupcion y la Impunidad, a civil group, calculated corruption was worth between 2 percent and 10 percent of Mexico s gross domestic product, based on data from the World Bank, the International Monetary Fund and others. Tax evasion and associated crimes accounted for the biggest source of illicit wealth identified by the study at 484 billion pesos ($25.3 billion), followed by trade in cocaine and marijuana at 404 billion pesos. The report did not address income from heroin and methamphetamine, which make up a large chunk of the drug trade.   Nor did it include white collar crimes such as embezzlement of public funds and insider trading, trafficking in people and arms, fuel theft and sexual exploitation. While incomplete, the findings stand in contrast to the amount of illicit funds the government has said it removed from circulation in recent years. According to government data, the organized crime unit of the attorney general s office secured $11.4 million and 543.2 million pesos in its anti-money laundering efforts between September 2016 and June 2017.

"U.S. Treasury tax study slammed as 'fake math' by Democrats. WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The U.S. Treasury Department on Monday released a one-page analysis of the economic and fiscal impact of a Republican tax overhaul plan that was swiftly criticized by a number of tax experts and attacked as “fake math” by Democrats. Treasury said the tax plan would more than pay for itself in 10 years, basing its forecast on a 2.9 percent annual economic growth assumption, a level well above most economists’ expectations, as well other changes on which the White House has made little progress. “We are pleased to release an analysis demonstrating the revenue impact of the administration’s economic agenda,” Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin, a former Goldman Sachs (GS.N) banker, said in a statement. The Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget, a conservative fiscal watchdog in Washington, said the Mnuchin analysis “makes a mockery of dynamic scoring and analysis,” referring to methods for forecasting the impact of tax changes on the economy. Senate Democratic leader Chuck Schumer said the Treasury analysis was “nothing more than one page of fake math.” “It’s clear the White House and Republicans are grasping at straws to prove the unprovable and garner votes for a bill that nearly every single independent analysis has concluded will blow up the deficit and generate almost no additional economic activity to make up for it,” he said in a statement.     The sparring over economic forecasts came as Republicans resumed efforts to reconcile two tax-overhaul bills, one approved by the Senate and one by the House of Representatives. President Donald Trump wants a single tax bill on his desk soon so he can sign it into law before the end of the year, in what would be his first major legislative achievement since taking office in January. The Republican president will deliver a speech on Wednesday “to the American people on how tax reform will lead to a brighter future for them and their families,” the White House said in a statement. Republicans are driving toward approval of a debt-financed package of deep tax cuts for businesses and the wealthy and a mixed bag of results for middle-class Americans. Although the Republicans see the effort as crucial to their prospects in November 2018’s congressional elections, nearly half of Americans oppose the plan, according to Reuters/Ipsos polling. The Treasury analysis was meant to help bolster long-standing promises from Republicans, including Mnuchin, that their proposed tax cuts would super-charge an already growing economy and raise more than enough new tax revenue to offset a large federal deficit increase. Congressional researchers have estimated the Republican plan would add $1.5 trillion to the $20 trillion national debt over 10 years, before any projected positive effects on the economy, or $1 trillion after such effects. In its analysis, Treasury said its projected 2.9 percent annual growth over the next decade would result not only from tax cuts but “a combination of regulatory reform, infrastructure development, and welfare reform as proposed in the administration’s Fiscal Year 2018 budget.” The Trump administration sent a budget to Congress earlier this year that lawmakers largely ignored. While the White House has rolled back some regulations, it has made no substantial progress on infrastructure development or welfare changes. Growth of 2.9 percent would produce $1.8 trillion in new tax revenues over 10 years, more than enough to offset the revenue that the tax plan would lose, the department said. “We acknowledge that some economists predict different growth rates,” it added in a statement accompanying its analysis, which focused on the tax plan as approved more than three weeks ago by the Senate Finance Committee. The full Senate on Dec. 2 approved a somewhat different plan, which would boost gross domestic product by 0.7 percent in 2018 and have little effect on GDP in the decade ahead, said the Tax Policy Center, a nonpartisan think tank, in a report on Monday. Wharton Business School at the University of Pennsylvania also issued a report on Monday finding the plan approved by the full Senate would add $1.5 trillion to the national debt over 10 years, “even with assumptions favorable to economic growth.” ",0,en

" A High School Student Just Bashed ‘You Deserve Rape’ Pastor’s Head In With A Baseball Bat (VIDEO). For years, a street preacher has been embarrassing Christians by peddling what can only be described as extremist bullsh*t unfit for a family gathering at the Palin household. Brother Dean Saxton, who has been raising eyebrows and blood pressures while simultaneously lowering the standards of human decency by standing around holding  you deserve rape  signs on college campuses and other places   a message to  whores  (that s  Christian extremist  for  women ) that if they decide to consume a single drop of alcohol, or wear something that exposes so much as an ankle or a shoulder blade they deserve whatever happens to them. I think that girls that dress and act like it,  Saxton told the Daily Wildcat in 2013,  they should realize that they do have partial responsibility, because I believe that they re pretty much asking for it.  He s also made some less-than nice remarks about African-Americans and the LGBT community   though he is most famous for telling every female rape victim that they were asking for it. Here are just a few examples of the dumbass bullsh*t that goes on inside the cesspool that is this jerk s mind:via Arizona Daily Wildcat   Now, you may have been wondering, a question may have been burning within you: when the hell is someone just going to take a baseball bat to this motherf*cker?While he was holding his hateful  You deserve to be raped  sign and condemning women who leave their homes without covering themselves head-to-toe in front of Apollo High School in Glendale, Arizona, a female student grabbed a baseball bat and hit him in the head. The Bible says it s not okay to be gay,  he yelled, holding his hateful  rape  sign in his hands in a double-whammy expression of hatred.  You need to stop doing naught, nasty things, Apollo High School. You need to stop looking up naughty, nasty things on the Internet.  All the while, for some inexplicable reason, he was recording the children.Video posted by the preacher himself shows numerous students and teachers approaching him, demanding that he leave. As one gentleman informed Saxton that he shouldn t be displaying this sort of message to kids, we hear a loud, metallic impact noise.With students cheering in the background, the gentleman to whom Saxton was speaking calmly said,  You see that? That s what I m telling you. Saxton then beat a hasty retreat as the students told him to get lost.Tabitha Brubaker, 19, was certainly wrong to respond with violence, but when you think about it it was really Saxton s fault by his own logic. Like men who can t resist raping those dirty, dirty whores who go outside looking like sluts with their elbows and knees showing (the ones he says deserve to be raped), we really can t blame Brubaker for giving into her inability to deal with misogynist bullsh*t and acting on her natural urge to bust this smarmy motherf*cker s head open. After all, by preaching hate in front of a high school, didn t he place himself in a scenario where he was likely to meet someone who wasn t willing to deal with his particular brand of awfulness?Though some would award her a medal, what Brubaker did was a crime and she has been charged with felony assault. She also had some weed on her, so she was charged with possession of a plant as well.Watch the full incident below:Featured image via screengrab",1,en
"“TRAITOR IN CHIEF” WARNS CONGRESS…Shut Down Prison With Muslim Terrorists Or I’ll Stop Funding Military [VIDEO]. Name one time this reckless  Commander in Chief  has put our men and women in uniform before the war on terror Just one.On Monday, the Obama administration announced that President Obama would veto a defense authorization bill if it did not close down Guantanamo Bay. White House press secretary Josh Earnest explained that the House funding bill would be vetoed  principally because of the irresponsible way that it funds our national defense priorities, but also because of the efforts to prevent the closure [of] the prison at Guantanamo Bay.  He added that Democrats would sustain Obama s veto, and defense authorization would die.Obama s strong stand on Gitmo underscores two vital points. First, President Obama does not fear defunding America s national security. Second, Obama does not fear Republicans in Congress.The National Defense Authorization Act (NDAA) has been authorized for five decades running. The current NDAA fully funds the military through a workaround measure, thanks to President Obama s demands that a huge chunk of sequestration cuts come from defense funding. Now Democrats complain that the workaround measure isn t good enough: Republicans should bust open the bank again.But that s not Obama s main criticism of the NDAA. He has long had a bug in his ear with regard to Gitmo, which he feels has strengthened terrorists  feelings about the evils of the United States. Given his recent moves to parlay with the Cuban dictatorship as well, Obama may want to hand Gitmo in totality back to the Cuban government. The fact that Obama would be willing to dramatically cut America s military funding, even as Russia takes over Ukraine and Syria, as Iran gears up for a big regional military push, as China continues its aggressive behavior in the South China Sea, demonstrates Obama s top priority is doing leftist work, not protecting the United States.In fact, Obama s choice to prioritize Gitmo above national security isn t a choice at all: Obama wants America s military slashed, and he wants Gitmo closed. Senator Sen. John McCain (R-AZ) agrees with Obama that Gitmo should be closed, but even he says that Obama has manipulated the process to create an impasse. According to Roll Call, McCain  has said the White House promised him a plan to close the prison, but has yet to present one. Without that, he has said he wouldn t be able to find the votes to do what the White House wants. Now, normally, Obama s nasty priorities would pose little threat to military funding: after all, Obama would be stymied by Republicans in Congress. And Obama has threatened to veto the NDAA before over Guantanamo; each time, Congress has called Obama s bluff, and he has signed the bill into law.But this time, the feeling is that Obama could be more serious. After all, with the legacy of Republicans folding on executive amnesty, the Iran deal, and funding for Planned Parenthood, among others, Obama probably feels he can leverage Gitmo out of existence. He believes that Republicans fear defense defunding more than he must   their constituents will hold them accountable, while he s in pure  f*** it list  mode. He also thinks that Republicans are unwilling to undergo a head-to-head matchup with him under almost any circumstances.And Obama is right. In his entire tenure as Commander-in-Chief, Obama has had to issue a grand total of four vetoes. Four. That s less than every president since Chester A. Arthur, who filled out James Garfield s term, serving less than four years. Obama has had a fully Republican Congress this year, and a Republican House since 2010. He has issued just two vetoes this year, one with regard to Keystone XL Pipeline, and the other with regard to a bill related to the National Labor Relations Board. All of his other major policy priorities have been guarded zealously by a Democratic minority or an unwilling Republican majority.So why wouldn t Obama try to hold Republicans  feet to the fire on defense authorization?Obama s mastery of Congress is unprecedented in American history; the only other candidates for that title either held Congressional dominance within their own party (Franklin Delano Roosevelt) or ruled a Congressional rump (Abraham Lincoln). Shutting down America s defense funding would be a crowning achievement for a president who cares more about weakening America s role in the world than defending her citizens.Via: Breitbart News",1,en

"Clinton's charity confirms Qatar's $1 million gift while she was at State Dept. NEW YORK (Reuters) - The Clinton Foundation has confirmed it accepted a $1 million gift from Qatar while Hillary Clinton was U.S. secretary of state without informing the State Department, even though she had promised to let the agency review new or significantly increased support from foreign governments. Qatari officials pledged the money in 2011 to mark the 65th birthday of Bill Clinton, Hillary Clinton’s husband, and sought to meet the former U.S. president in person the following year to present him the check, according to an email from a foundation official to Hillary Clinton’s presidential campaign chairman, John Podesta. The email, among thousands hacked from Podesta’s account, was published last month by WikiLeaks. Clinton signed an ethics agreement governing her family’s globe-straddling foundation in order to become secretary of state in 2009. The agreement was designed to increase transparency to avoid appearances that U.S. foreign policy could be swayed by wealthy donors. If a new foreign government wished to donate or if an existing foreign-government donor, such as Qatar, wanted to “increase materially” its support of ongoing programs, Clinton promised that the State Department’s ethics official would be notified and given a chance to raise any concerns. Clinton Foundation officials last month declined to confirm the Qatar donation. In response to additional questions, a foundation spokesman, Brian Cookstra, this week said that it accepted the $1 million gift from Qatar, but this did not amount to a “material increase” in the Gulf country’s support for the charity. Cookstra declined to say whether Qatari officials received their requested meeting with Bill Clinton.  Officials at Qatar’s embassy in Washington and in its Council of Ministers in the capital, Doha, declined to discuss the donation. The State Department has said it has no record of the foundation submitting the Qatar gift for review, and that it was incumbent on the foundation to notify the department about donations that needed attention. A department spokeswoman did not respond to additional questions about the donation. According to the foundation’s website, which lists donors in broad categories by cumulative amounts donated, Qatar’s government has directly given a total of between $1 million and $5 million over the years.  The Clinton Foundation has said it would no longer accept money from foreign governments if Clinton is elected president and would spin off those programs that are dependent on foreign governments.    Foundation officials told Reuters last year that they did not always comply with central provisions of the agreement with President Barack Obama's administration, blaming oversights in some cases.(reut.rs/2fkHPCh) At least eight other countries besides Qatar gave new or increased funding to the foundation, in most cases to fund its health project, without the State Department being informed, according to foundation and agency records. They include Algeria, which gave for the first time in 2010, and the United Kingdom, which nearly tripled its support for the foundation’s health project to $11.2 million between 2009 and 2012. Foundation officials have said some of those donations, including Algeria, were oversights and should have been flagged, while others, such as the UK increase, did not qualify as material increases. The foundation has declined to describe what sort of increase in funding by a foreign government would have triggered notification of the State Department for review. Cookstra said the agreement was designed to “allow foreign funding for critical Clinton Foundation programs” to continue without disruption.  The State Department said it has no record of being asked by the foundation to review any increases in support by a foreign government. Asked whether Qatar was funding a specific program at the foundation, Cookstra said the country supported the organization’s “overall humanitarian work.”  “Qatar continued supporting Clinton Foundation at equal or lower levels” compared with the country’s pre-2009 support, he said. He declined to say if Qatar gave any money during the first three years of Clinton’s four-year term at the State Department, or what its support before 2009 amounted to.   In another email released by WikiLeaks, a former Clinton Foundation fundraiser said he raised more than $21 million in connection with Bill Clinton’s 65th birthday in 2011.  Spokesmen for Hillary Clinton’s campaign and Bill Clinton did not respond to emailed questions about the donation.      Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump has said that major donors to the Clinton Foundation may have obtained favored access to Clinton’s State Department, but has provided little evidence to that effect. Clinton and her staff have dismissed this accusation as a political smear. Last month, New York Attorney General Eric Schneiderman ordered the Donald J. Trump Foundation to stop fundraising in the state, saying it had not registered to solicit donations. ",0,en

" Fox News Fires One Of Its Longest Running Hosts After He’s Caught Making Racist Remark To Employee. The latest in a seemingly unending torrent of scandals and toxicity coming from Fox News, the network says it was forced to abruptly fire Bob Beckel after the longtime host of The Five made a  racially insensitive remark  to an African-American Fox News employee. The firing comes just weeks after the conservative channel faced a class-action lawsuit that alleged executives would entertain themselves by forcing black female employees to arm wrestle white employees.Beckel himself had a history with inflammatory, offensive comments. Ostensibly the channel s token  liberal,  Beckel proved himself to be anything but with repeated misogynistic and racist comments. In 2014, Beckel was briefly suspended after using the derogatory term  Chinamen  while bashing the Chinese government.His remarks towards an African-American employee were apparently the final straw: Bob Beckel was terminated today for making an insensitive remark to an African-American employee,  the network said in a statement. Fox News  human-resources department was made aware of a complaint about what one person familiar with the situation characterized as a  racially insensitive remark  on Tuesday evening. Executives conducted an internal investigation, this person said, and decided to part ways with Beckel Friday morning.It may be small consolation to the countless people its hurt over the years, but Fox News is having an exceptionally bad year. Despite their guy winning the election, the network has been plagued by scandals big and small.Worse still, by refusing to cover Trump honestly, the network has seen its ratings plummet. It now consistently loses to rivals CNN and MSNBC in primetime viewers, who tune into the other networks to learn about the Trump scandals Fox refuses to cover.And at this point, it s not entirely clear whether Fox News can ever fully recover from the culture of misogyny and racism that Ailes built. The fact that Beckel is still using racial slurs seems to suggest the problems go much deeper than any one host.UPDATE: The attorneys representing the man verbally harassed by Beckel have come forward with the victim s account of Beckel s behavior. It s bad. Mr. Beckel stormed out of his office when our client, a Black [sic] IT employee came to service his computer, telling our client that he was leaving his office because he is Black,  the attorneys said in a statement. They also allege that when their client went to lodge a complaint against Beckel, Fox News Chief Human Resource Officer Kevin Lord tried to intimidate him and convince him to withdraw the complaint.It appears that even when ultimately deciding to fire Beckel, Fox still behaved with characteristic awfulness.Featured image via Fox News",1,en
"SAY WHAT? #BlackLivesMatter TEXTBOOKS TO BE USED AS PART OF COMMON CORE CURRICULUM IN GRADES 6-12 [Video]. When will American citizens stop being afraid to stand up and SPEAK OUT against the  politically correct  thugs of the left?A new  Black Lives Matter  textbook will soon be available to middle school and high school classrooms.According to the publisher s description,  Black Lives Matter  covers the shootings that touched off passionate protests, the work of activists to bring about a more just legal system, and the tensions in U.S. society that these events have brought to light. ABDO Publishing specifies that the book was written for sixth graders through high school students, and says the textbook is  aligned to Common Core Standards and correlated to state standards. Until now, no authoritative text designed to teach non-black children about historical-structural inequalities productive of anti-black violence in U.S. law and society has been made available for commercial consumption,  reads a review in The Feminist Wire. Parents as well as teachers eager to teach middle and/or high school students about the routine vulnerability and terror generative of the rejoined,  Black Lives Matter,  will find an invaluable resource in this special report. Conservative radio commentator Larry Elder weighed in on Fox and Friends over the weekend. [The textbook] is indoctrinating young kids, teaching them black people are victims,  Elder said.He argued that the movement would be better off addressing black-on-black crime. If the  Black Lives Matter  people are really concerned, they ought to say something about the fact that last year 6,000 blacks shot other blacks, and far and away the number one cause of preventable death for young black men is homicide,  he added. The textbook was co-authored by Missouri journalist Sue Bradford Edwards and Duchess Harris, a professor of American Studies at Macalester College in Minnesota. Harris is also the author of  Black Feminist Politics from Kennedy to Obama  and a co-editor of  Racially Writing the Republic: Racists, Race Rebels, and Transformations of American Identity. Black Lives Matter  is part of ABDO Publishing s  Special Report  series of books that aim  to help readers develop an essential understanding of current events and encourage them to form their own opinions. There are a total of eight titles in the  Special Report  series, including  Ebola Outbreak,   ISIS,  and  Transgender Rights and Issues.  Via: Red Alert Politics ",1,en
"Connecticut governor vetoes budget as spending cuts loom. NEW YORK (Reuters) - Connecticut Governor Dannel Malloy on Thursday vetoed the $40.7 billion biennial budget passed by lawmakers earlier this month, saying the bill would undermine the state’s fiscal stability, education system and economic development. Malloy, a second-term Democrat who is not running for reelection, had said he would not approve the Republican-supported budget.  Without a budget, which is now nearly three months overdue, the state could implement severe cuts on Oct. 1 under an emergency spending plan put in place by Malloy. Republican lawmakers, who do not control the legislature but won support for their budget from a handful of Democrats, have said they may try to override the governor’s veto, which was expected. As the state continues to wrangle over how to close a 2-year, $3.5 billion budget gap, some Connecticut cities are in the firing because of reduced state aid. Credit ratings agency S&P Global Ratings on Thursday put nine cities and a school district on alert for possible downgrades. The warning “reflects Connecticut’s ongoing budget impasse and brinkmanship, which could reduce significant amounts of municipal aid payments to local governments,” said S&P analyst Victor Medeiros. “The credit quality of these municipalities could deteriorate further due to weaker reserves and liquidity concerns.” The cities - which include its largest, Bridgeport, and New Haven - are likely to dip into their reserves to offset losses in state aid. The drain on reserves would “make their financial position all the more precarious,” Medeiros said. The capital city, Hartford, was not on the list but has been downgraded four times in the last few weeks. On Wednesday, it fell multiple notches deeper into junk territory as it faces a potential bankruptcy.     Under the Republican plan, Hartford would have lost $6.8 million dollars of state support “at a time when its financial future is in peril, almost certainly forcing it into bankruptcy,” Malloy said in his veto message. Malloy also took issue with proposals to cut state public pension benefits, which could lead to expensive court challenges from public employee unions, and an education funding plan that he said was inequitable. State Senate Republican President Pro Tempore Len Fasano said in a statement that the veto had “put Connecticut in chaos.” The veto means that cuts under Malloy’s “draconian executive order will remain in effect and create destruction for low and middle income families” unless lawmakers vote to override it, Fasano said.

"“HILL”ARIOUS…MUST SEE! IOWA PARADE GOERS Treated To “Hillary In Prison” Float…Water Balloon Passed Out To Throw At Her.  HILL larious! If this was a Donald Trump pi ata, the media would be all over this story, making sure the entire country knew how unpopular he was in midwestern America. But since these creative Iowan s choose to put Hillary in jail, which makes an undeniable statement about her credibility, you will likely only see this story here and a few other news sources who are willing to show you what real Americans think about Hillary Kyle Julin. of Manilla, pulls his Hillary Clinton-masked friend Adam Corky, of Odeboldt, through the parade during the Arcadia Fire Department s 100th Anniversary Celebration on Saturday. The group received both accolades and criticisms for handing out water ballons to throw at the candidate. (Carrolls Paper)IT GETS BETTER The men were handing out WATER BALLOONS to throw at the caged Hillary!It was a typical summer celebration in small-town Iowa. The sun was shining on children carrying bags full of candy as the Arcadia Fire Department was celebrating its 100th anniversary on Saturday with a parade, a party in the park and a big water fight that would serve as the grand finale.A young blond boy, no more than 8 years old, ran out into the street near the intersection of West Center and South Gault streets because one float was handing out water balloons. The child grabbed his balloon, took aim and did his best Nolan Ryan impression as he fired the balloon at a man dressed in an orange jumpsuit and Hillary Clinton mask while standing on a platform inside bars, fencing and barbed wire above a  Hillary For Prison  sign tacked onto the side.Bull s eye.The prideful smile of a job well done was written all over the boy s face.Some in the crowd were laughing and cheering as the float rolled by, but others could be heard moaning and grumbling that it was  over the top  or  a bit too much. It was my idea,  Kyle Julin of Manilla said.  Pretty much me and Josh (Reetz). It took us about a day-and-a-half to build. Julin said he, Reetz and Adam Corky (Clinton impersonator) are not affiliated with any official political organization. Julin said he s an independent and as of March 2014 Reetz was a registered Democrat.Julin said the crew had been throwing around the idea of entering the parade for a while.Via: Gateway Pundit ",1,en

"Cuba, North Korea reject 'unilateral and arbitrary' U.S. demands. HAVANA (Reuters) - Cuba s foreign minister and his North Korean counterpart rejected the United States   unilateral and arbitrary  demands on Wednesday while expressing concern about escalating tensions on the Korean peninsula, the ministry said. North Korea is searching for support amid unprecedented pressure from the United States and the international community to cease its nuclear weapons and missile programs, which it carries out in defiance of U.N. Security Council resolutions. The country, which has made no secret of its plans to develop a missile capable of hitting the U.S. mainland, has maintained warm political relations with Cuba since 1960, despite the island s opposition to nuclear weapons. Some diplomats said Cuba was also one of the few countries that might be able to convince North Korea to move away from the current showdown with the United States that threatens war. The ministers, meeting in Havana, called for  respect for peoples  sovereignty  and  the peaceful settlement of disputes,  according to a statement released by the Cuban foreign ministry.  They strongly rejected the unilateral and arbitrary lists and designations established by the U.S. government which serve as a basis for the implementation of coercive measures which are contrary to international law,  the statement said. U.S. President Donald Trump has also increased pressure on Cuba since taking office, rolling back a fragile detente begun by predecessor Barack Obama and returning to the hostile rhetoric of the Cold War. A U.S. State Department official, speaking on condition of anonymity, said that the United States had made clear it wanted a peaceful resolution to the North Korean nuclear issue.  The DPRK s belligerent and provocative behavior demonstrates it has no interest in working toward a peaceful solution,  the official said. DPRK stands for North Korea s official name, the Democratic People s Republic of Korea. Cuba said in the statement the Cuban and North Korean foreign ministers had  expressed concern about the escalation of tensions  on the Korean peninsula.  The ministers discussed the respective efforts carried out in the construction of socialism according to the realities inherent to their respective countries.  Cuba and North Korea are the last in the world to maintain Soviet-style command economies, though under President Raul Castro, the Caribbean nation has taken some small steps toward the more market-oriented communism of China and Vietnam. Cuba maintains an embassy in North Korea, but publicly trades almost exclusively with the South. Last year, trade with the latter was $67 million and with the North just $9 million, according to the Cuban government. North Korea defends its weapons programs as a necessary defense against U.S. plans to invade. The United States, which has 28,500 troops in South Korea, a legacy of the 1950-53 Korean war, denies any such intentions. ",0,en

" Cleveland School Officer Placed On Leave After HORRIBLE Message About Tamir Rice’s Mom (IMAGES/VIDEO). An officer at a Cleveland school has come under fire after he posted a status on Facebook that called the mother of slain Tamir Rice a  stupid b*tch  and made vile, insensitive remarks about young police brutality victims.Rice, a 12-year-old from Cleveland, was shot and killed last year by police officer Timothy Loehmann, who saw him playing with a toy gun and shot the boy dead before investigating the situation fully. Last week, Loehmann was let off the hook and cleared of the charges filed against him. Two days after this announcement, Cleveland Metropolitan School District officer Matt Cicero decided to voice his opinion on Rice s case over social media. The page is no longer available, but fortunately the screenshots are. He wrote: Tamir rices momma just want money. Lets make the proper changes raise your kids not to play with fake guns stupid bitch. All this media because the are notgetting what they want  Again pleeeeze anyone who does not like what I post ..unfriendly me or block me your not worth my time. Matt CiceroThis disturbing meme was also found on his Facebook page:Matt CiceroMany people came to the innocent victim s defense, saying that Rice hadn t deserved to die just because he was playing with a toy. Cicero couldn t be reasoned out of his ignorant mindset. He responded to his critics: You pull out a gun you get shot. I don t have time to ask questions and coddle kids that wave guns around. Matt CiceroIn the past, Cicero had patrolled the school district where Rice went to school, and it s horrifying to think that someone with this attitude would be trusted enough to protect children. Cicero has been placed on administrative leave since this incident has gotten attention, however many   including Cleveland City Councilman Jeff Johnson   think Cicero should be flat-out fired. Addressing Cicero s comments, Johnson said: It s disrespectful to women, it s disrespectful to African-Americans. The fact that he s so insensitive and he s placing the blame of Tamir s death on Tamir, for me that s enough for him to be not working with children in the Cleveland school system. Cleveland Metropolitan School District spokeswoman Roseann Canfora called Cicero s comments insensitive at best. In a statement, she wrote: While we respect every employee s right to freedom of speech, with those rights comes a responsibility to do so in ways that are appropriate and sensitive to others, particularly to the people we serve.

" Wealthy Teen Gets Homeless Man To Pour Coffee Over Himself For $5, Then Karma Calls (VIDEO). A New Jersey teenager thought it would be funny to pay a homeless man $5 to pour coffee over himself. But after the story went viral, the homeless man is now being crowdfunded out of poverty, and that teen is facing the consequences of his actions.65-year-old Ronald Leggatt has been facing the east coast ice storms from a vantage point that most of us couldn t even imagine. While people shiver next to fires in their homes, Leggatt is on the streets, in sub-zero temperatures. Surviving each day is a miracle.On Monday, he was approached by a local teen. He might have hoped for some kind words, or some cash towards extra clothing or food.Instead, the teen offered the desperate man $5 to pour coffee over his own head. So he obliged. 22-year-old local Carlos Mejia posted images of the incident to Facebook, saying: At first I thought it was an act of kindness but I was wrong, The poor man s eyes and face were red because of the burning coffee, In the image, the teen can be seen shaking the hand of a clearly injured Leggatt.After Mejia s post went viral, Lakewood Police investigated the incident and verified that it did take place. But sadly, no charges can be filed against the teen. They said in a statement: After further investigation it was determined, that although the incident occurred in poor judgement, it did not rise to a criminal act, Evidence in the case revealed that both parties were willing participants and no one was injured. But the local community were so outraged by the incident, that they located Ronald Leggatt and decided to provide him with as much assistance as they could muster. First, they got his hair cut, provided him with a decent washroom, and bought him new clothes.They then set up a crowd fund campaign to provide reparations to Leggatt in behalf of the entire community. More than $3,000 has already been raised to help get Laggatt back on his feet.Ari Boyer, a Lakewood resident, told the New York Daily News: The truth is that I saw the thing on Facebook and thought it was a horrible thing to do, I just don t like to see people hurt. Leggatt is almost unrecognizable in his new clothes, clean and trim.But while Laggatt s life has turned around, the teen who abused him in his hour of need has been shamed publicly. So excruciating was the embarrassment, he made a video apology for Ronald Leggatt, offering him $20 and to pour coffee over his own head.Laggatt politely declined the offer.The case is a reminder of the very worst, and the very best, any community of human beings has to offer. Thank goodness that the better angels of Lakewood came together to stand for Ronald Leggatt.Featured Image via YouTube Screengrab",1,en

Ask your liberal friends to tell you more about these  poor women and children  who are fleeing persecution from radical Islamists in the Middle East The recent surge of migration into Europe has been unprecedented in scope, with an estimated 1 million migrants from the Middle East and North Africa this past year alone, making for a massive humanitarian crisis, as well as a political and moral dilemma for European governments. But one crucial dimension of this crisis has gone little-noticed: sex or, more technically, sex ratios.According to official counts, a disproportionate number of these migrants are young, unmarried, unaccompanied males. In fact, the sex ratios among migrants are so one-sided we re talking worse than those in China, in some cases that they could radically change the gender balance in European countries in certain age cohorts.  PoliticoA leaked German government report has warned, that up to 6.6 million people are waiting in countries around the Mediterranean to cross into Europe, according to details of the classified report leaked to Bild newspaper.Here s a video that s being circulated on social media today, of a boatload of young, male immigrants who are speaking Arabic as they record their trip on a smartphone. Note to bleeding heart liberals: These are clearly not impoverished men or women and children who are escaping persecution by Islamic extremists.New boatload of scared/hungry women and children on their way to Europe. At least they had their smart phone to document the journey. pic.twitter.com/svLUy6mO9K  Based Monitored   (@BasedMonitored) August 22, 2017The high percentage of young males flooding European countries will soon be a very serious problem:Politico   As many governments, including in the United States, debate how many migrants to accept onto their shores, they would be wise to take gender balance into consideration. That might sound sexist on the surface, but years of research has shown that male-dominated societies are less stable, because they are more susceptible to higher levels of violence, insurgence and mistreatment of women. In Germany, scores of women recently reported being attacked on New Year s Eve by men whom the authorities describe as of  North African or Arabic  descent. While it is not yet known whether the alleged perpetrators were migrants, the attacks may finally be alerting policymakers to the risks of a male-dominated migration wave.Why would European societies, many of which rank highest on global measures of gender equality and stability and peace, jeopardize those hard-won and enviable rankings?That imbalance might not sound radical, but it is, especially when you look more closely at who those males are. It s true that many male migrants hope that, if granted asylum, they will be joined in Europe by their wives and children, who would help balance out national sex ratios. But importantly, more than 20 percent of migrants are minors below the age of 18, and the IOM estimates that more than half of those minors traveling to Europe are traveling as unaccompanied minors 90 percent of whom are males. This heavily male subset is all but guaranteed asylum because of their status as unaccompanied minors, but they get no special dispensation to bring spouses, especially since the European Court of Human Rights recently ruled that European Union countries are not required to recognize the legality of child marriages among migrants.

"FBI REDUX: What’s Behind New Probe into Hillary Clinton Emails?. 21st Century Wire says In a stunning turn of events 11 days before the 2016 presidential election, the FBI announced it is reopenning its investigation into Hillary Clinton s email server case, by probing newly emerging emails linked to Hillary Clinton.  NEW PROBE    The FBI gives Hillary Clinton a second look. (Photo illustraion 21WIRE)FBI October Surprise?According to reports, in a letter written today, FBI Director James Comey, stated that the FBI has begun a new probe into Hillary Clinton related emails once again. Comey offered scant details about the new probe, but due to an unrelated case, additional classified material may have been mishandled on Clinton s personal email server.CNBC reported the latest FBI developments, including a passage from Comey s letter discussing the new investigation: In previous congressional testimony, I referred to the fact that the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) had completed its investigation of former Secretary Clinton s personal email server. Due to recent developments, I am writing to supplement my previous testimony,  Comey wrote.In connection with an unrelated case, the FBI has learned of the existence of emails that appear to be pertinent to the investigation. I am writing to inform you that the investigative team briefed me on this yesterday, and I agreed that the FBI should take appropriate investigative steps designed to allow investigators to review these emails to determine whether they contain classified information, as well as to assess their importance to our investigation,  he added.Although the FBI cannot yet assess whether or not this material may be significant, and I cannot predict how long it will take us to complete this additional work, I believe it is important to update your Committees about our efforts in light of my previous testimony,  Comey concluded. Huma s Estranged  Sexting  HusbandAccording to a new report released via The New York Times: The presidential campaign was rocked on Friday after federal law enforcement officials said that emails pertinent to the now-closed investigation into Hillary Clinton s private email server were discovered on a computer belonging to Anthony D. Weiner, the estranged husband of a top Clinton aide. In a letter to Congress, the F.B.I. director, James B. Comey, said the emails had surfaced in an unrelated case, which law enforcement officials said was an F.B.I. investigation into illicit text messages from Mr. Weiner to a 15-year-old girl in North Carolina. Mr. Weiner, a former Democratic congressman from New York, is married to Huma Abedin, the top aide. Comey has come under fire recently for apparently letting Clinton off the hook for mishandling, and lying to Congress, about classified emails coming through her  home brew  email server while she was Secretary of State. After previously closing the case, Comey has done a U-turn and is now saying the FBI will review the new emails to for classified information, and see whether it was mishandled.This unprecedented investigative move comes just two days after a Wikileaks docu-dump revealed a memo containing detailed financial information between Clinton Foundation donors and former president Bill Clinton s private financial activities. Among those included in the memo, was a $30 million dollar business arrangement under  Bill Clinton, Inc.,  with another $66 million dollar deal scheduled over nine years.The following is a tweet from Brad Jaffy of NBC Nightly News containing the new FBI recommendation The new investigation into the Clinton camp will most certainly spark new  Pay-to-Play  allegations, as the new FBI revelations also comes days after a Project Veritas hidden camera sting operation revealed that the Democratic consultant Robert Creamer of Democracy Partners, discussed ways to commit  large-scale  voter fraud as well as paying political agitators to cause violence at Donald Trump rallies.Out of Creamer s 342 visits to the White House, also included his wife, a 9-term Illinois Democratic congresswoman, Jan Schakowsky some 47 times.White House visitor records show that Schakowsky took 47  private meetings with Obama or his senior staff, also over the past year. The consultancy Democracy Partners appears to have applied Schakowsky as a political buffering point, possibly in the event of a fallout over their operations at a grassroots level. The impetus of this type of procedural separation is to keep certain high-ranking officials of the hook in case of a massive upheaval over various underhanded campaign tactics  thus giving a political campaign or political entity plausible deniability.  CAUGHT ON FILM    Robert Creamer resigns over a massive Democratic Party controversy. (Image Source: CNN)Creamer, a convicted felon, (in 2005, Creamer plead guilty $2.3 million in bank fraud and tax violations) was promptly shoved out of the Hillary Clinton campaign s inner circle,  following a heavily publicized video sting revealing his discussion about voter fraud and violence at Trump rallies. PAY TO PLAY?    Virginia Governor Terry McAuliffe closely allied with the Clinton s negotiated a a campaign contribution involving the FBI. (Image Source new republic)It remains unclear what exactly reopened the new Clinton probe, but perhaps the FBI had its own cobwebs to clear out after it was revealed that a longtime Clinton associate, Virginia Gov. Terry McAuliffe,  helped steer $675,000 to the election campaign of the wife of an FBI official who went on to lead the probe into Hillary Clinton s use of a private email system, according to a report. The NY Post also reported on the matter this past week: The political action committee of McAuliffe, the Clinton loyalist, gave $467,500 to the state Senate campaign of the wife of Andrew McCabe, who is now deputy director of the FBI, according to the Wall Street Journal.The report states Jill McCabe received an additional $207,788 from the Virginia Democratic Party, which is heavily influenced by McAuliffe.The money directed by McAuliffe began flowing two months after the FBI investigation into Clinton began in July 2015. Around that time, the candidate s husband was promoted from running the Washington field office for the FBI to the No. 3 position at the bureau. In a CNN report from October 18th, a week before the McAuliffe revelations,  According to notes from interviews conducted during an FBI investigation into Clinton s email practices, Undersecretary of State Patrick Kennedy personally tried to convince FBI officials that the email should be declassified. One interviewee described feeling  pressured  by another FBI official at Kennedy s request. The newly reopened FBI investigation into Clinton could be related to all or some of the items listed above, but there s no doubt that due to public backlash the FBI received following the first Clinton investigation, in addition to concerns over dealings between the FBI and Clinton associates   the agency needed to save face.It remains to be seen how new case will impact the US Presidential election.More from RT below (Image Source: youtube)FBI reopens Clinton investigation as new emails found   ComeyRTThe FBI has learned of more emails involving Hillary Clinton s private email server while she headed the State Department, FBI Director James Comey told several members of Congress, telling them he is reopening the investigation.

"Egyptian air force says strikes arms convoy at Libya border. CAIRO (Reuters) - The Egyptian military said on Monday its air force hit eight four-wheel-drive vehicles carrying arms and explosives at Egypt s western border with Libya, killing the militants on board. A military statement gave no details of the number of fatalities or about which militant group it suspected was transporting the arms. Last Friday Egypt s security forces suffered one of their deadliest attacks, when militants killed police officers using rockets and explosives in a remote area about 135 km (85 miles) southwest of Cairo.    Egyptian security forces have been battling an insurgency by Islamic State that was largely concentrated in the Sinai Peninsula but has in recent months extended to other parts of the country. Egypt has carried out air strikes in Libya occasionally since its neighbor descended into factional fighting in the years following the 2011 civil war that ousted Muammar Gaddafi. In a separate statement, Egypt s armed forces said they had  raided a terrorist stronghold in northern Sinai, killing six very dangerous takfiris  - a term used by hardline Muslims to accuse other Muslims of apostasy.  The statement added that in the raid, which was carried out after the military received information of the stronghold, security forces confiscated  a large amount of arms and ammunition.   ",0,en

" A Former President Of Mexico Is THANKING Donald Trump For His ‘Racist’ Ideas – Here’s Why (VIDEO). Vicente Fox, the former president of Mexico who served from 2000 to 2006, has spoken openly about his disdain for Republican front-runner Donald Trump before, but this time he has a special message to give the business mogul.In an op-ed The Guardian released on Wednesday, Fox actually thanked Trump for his  disgraceful and highly offensive language,  while also brutally condemning the racist, vulgar candidate. In the column entitled  Let s raise our voices against this dictator, Donald Trump, Fox wrote: Trump has said Mexicans are the problem, calling us rapists and criminals. He thinks building the  Trump Wall  will right every wrong in the United States. Indeed, he s built a huge mental wall around himself already, which doesn t allow him to see the greatness of our people.Despite that, I want to thank him for his racist and ignorant ideas. Thanks to them, Mexico is in the global spotlight; every day, more and more people inside and outside the United States are realizing the decent way Mexicans live their lives. Fox then gave some amazing examples about how Trump s hate speech has actually helped to elevate the success of the Mexicans Trump spends so much time insulting: This year, a Mexican cinematographer won his third Academy Award in a row. In science and technology, a number of young and bright Mexicans won the International Robotics Tournament in 2015. And in Silicon Valley, one of the key advisers during the creation of Google was a Mexican professor: Hector Garc a Molina. Fox went further and condemned Trump s hateful rhetoric as a  lose-lose  proposition, stating that isolating immigrants will only hurt America, as they have already contributed so much to this country   something that Trump conveniently ignores whenever he s in anti-immigrant mode (even though he himself has relied on many immigrants to run his businesses and properties). Fox said: He says that he ll make America great again, but I believe he s only making it worse. America is already great, largely thanks to the hard work and perseverance of immigrants from all over the world who made it their home. Did you know that 40% of the Fortune 500 companies in the United States have been founded by immigrants? You can read the entire scathing message to Trump here.It s honestly always a pleasure whenever Fox attacks Trump   he never disappoints. Fox s criticism is consistently dead-on, like the time that he said Trump reminded him of Hitler, or when he epically shut down Trump s idea that Mexico would pay for his stupid  f*cking wall  (which is so great, you can watch it below if you haven t seen it already):Fox ends his op-ed with a powerful call-to-action to all immigrants, Americans and people around the world to resist Trump and his divisive rhetoric: I ask every Mexican, inside and outside our country, every American and the rest of the world to stand together. Let us not divide our dreams and opportunities; let us be inspired by compassion and true leadership. Let s raise our voice against this dictator and together let s walk towards harmony and prosperity all over the globe. Featured image via Vicente Fox Twitter",1,en

"AFTER 8 Years Of Silence From Obama On Cop Killings, Race Riots, Burning Cities To Ground…NYT’s Calls On Trump To “Denounce Hate” [VIDEO]. Here s just one of many discussions of assassinating Trump onTwitter: Here s a sweet little girl on Twitter who appears to be Hispanic with a vile anti-Trump message, showing a picture of a bloodied and body-less  Trump head  that appears to be sitting on a bed:Even this writer, who allegedly works for The Guardian was openly calling for Trump s assassination: Here s a touching story about an 11 year old boy who was beaten by his classmates after he admitted to voting for Trump in a mock-election at school:https://twitter.com/Pamela_Moore13/status/796883706950676480And unbelievably, the media weighs in on the  fear  that pro-Hillary Americans are feeling right now.That's strange, Harry Reid, because all I've seen over the last 48 hours is Trump supporters being violently attacked. pic.twitter.com/GDrp9GPtCa  Paul Joseph Watson (@PrisonPlanet) November 11, 2016In his victory speech early Wednesday morning, Donald Trump pledged that he  will be president for all Americans,  and he asked those who did not support him  for your guidance and your help so that we can work together and unify our great country. Here s some guidance right off the bat, Mr. President-elect: Those sentiments will have more force if you immediately and unequivocally repudiate the outpouring of racist, sexist, xenophobic, anti-Semitic and homophobic insults, threats and attacks being associated with your name. Do this in a personal plea to people who supported your candidacy. Tell them this is not what you stand for, nor is it what your new administration will tolerate.Explicit expressions of bigotry and hatred by Trump supporters were common throughout the campaign, and they have become even more intense since his election. On a department-store window in Philadelphia, vandals spray-painted  Sieg Heil 2016  and Mr. Trump s name written with a swastika. In a Minnesota high-school bathroom, vandals scrawled the Trump campaign slogan,  Make America Great Again,  and next to it,  Go back to Africa.  There are many more reports pouring in of verbal and physical harassment of Muslims, Latinos and other members of minorities. Though not all are verifiable, the atmosphere of intimidation and fear is unquestionably real and will keep growing. Mr. Trump may not be able to stop it by himself, but he must do everything he can.The problem, of course, is that Mr. Trump s campaign was based on appeals   some explicit, some coded   to racial and ethnic resentment and division. His followers heard it starting with his speech declaring his candidacy, warning of Mexican immigrant  rapists,  continuing to a rally last weekend where he promised to bar all Syrian refugees because they  will import generations of terrorism, extremism and radicalism into your schools and throughout your communities.  These statements emboldened and even encouraged those who have been looking for a license to lash out against immigrants, refugees, minorities and anyone else they find threatening. They take his victory as vindication of their feelings.Here are paid protesters and anarchists destroying public property and fighting with each other. Men are openly punching women as other women beg them to stop. But this is probably Trump s fault. He should just come out and denounce the  hate  against him and they ll all go home to their parents basements .right?Smashing an electrical box with a baseball bat while dozens of people stand nearby.The Alt-Left in action. #TrumpRiot pic.twitter.com/Gx2PWSEWgw  Paul Joseph Watson (@PrisonPlanet) November 11, 2016And finally, from the NYT s:As a candidate, Mr. Trump could get away with ignoring racist and sexist abuse by his supporters. But as the president-elect, he has the moral duty to reject it in the most aggressive terms. There should be no space in American political discourse for violent or abusive behavior. And that includes, of course, acts of vandalism and other violence by anti-Trump demonstrators. ",1,en

"NORWAY’S TOUGH Immigration Minister BLASTS Sweden, WARNS Refugees: “If You Are An Economic Migrant” or an “Illegal Immigrant” You’ll Be Sent Home. Norway has a new immigration sheriff in town, and so far, it appears that she s singing the same tune as President Trump on immigration. And oh yeah, Sylvi Listhaug  doesn t give a damn  about her critics either. How far are bleeding-heart nations, like Sweden, France, the UK, and Germany willing to take this mass-immigration experiment, before they realize it s too late to turn back? Before her appointment to the cabinet on December 16, Listhaug, then agriculture minister, criticized what she called a  tyranny of kindness that is blowing over Norwegian society like a nightmare. It is very serious that politicians are using punitive measures that would make it more difficult for a number of asylum seekers who are entitled to protection,  asylum association spokesman Andreas Furuseth told the Norwegian news agency NTB.Listhaug said she wanted 40 or so major and minor asylum law changes submitted to parliament in February before the European spring season, when asylum seeker arrivals were expected to rise again.She told Norwegian NRK public television that her legislative package amounted to a  sharp retrenchment  on wide social entitlements previously granted to refugees.Some 35,000 asylum seekers arrived in Norway in 2015.It was a record for the oil and gas-rich Nordic nation of 5.2 million people, which in recent weeks saw fewer arrivals, in part because of border controls reintroduced in neighboring Sweden and the arrival of wintry weather.NRK said the proposed rule tightening would allow family reunifications only after the applicant had acquired four years of work or education in Norway.And, the government would issue voucher cards instead of cash for day-to-day items to prevent applicants from sending money to family back home.Migrants who arrived on transit visas via Russia would not be granted asylum.Older applicants in the 55 to 67 age group would be required to learn the Norwegian language and aspects of Norwegian society.Applicants who fail to present identity documents will be refused asylum. A grant of temporary residence would not automatically lead to permanent residence.  DWWhen Angela Merkel invited refugees to Germany in 2015, tearing up the rules obliging migrants to seek asylum in the first country they arrive in, the consequences were pretty immediate. Over 160,000 went to Sweden, leading to well-publicised disruption. Next door, things were different. Norway took in just 30,000; this year it has accepted just 2,000 so far. To Sylvi Listhaug, the country s young immigration minister, this might still be a bit too much. We have a big challenge now to integrate those with permission to stay in Norway to make sure they respect Norwegian values,  she says.  Freedom to speak, to write, to believe or not to believe in a god, how to raise your children.  Also, she says, what not to do. For example:  It is not allowed to beat your children in Norway. It s unusual for a European government minister to link immigration with child-beating, but the 39-year-old Ms Listhaug is accustomed to speaking plainly. The rest of Europe, she believes, is coming around to the Norwegian position.After decades in opposition, her Progress Party entered government four years ago, a junior partner in a Conservative-run coalition. Her party envisaged the problems of mass migration in the 1980s, she says, so was well ahead of the populist upstarts now haunting so much of Europe.  A lot of them are socialist parties but against immigration. We are a libertarian party. We want less government, so people should decide more over their own life. And we want a stricter immigration policy because that s important for Norway in the long run. While Sweden and others saw the migration of 2015 as a blip caused by conflict in Syria and Iraq, she sees it as part of an irreversible demographic trend.  Africa is going to gain almost 500 million more people by 2030,  she says.  Much of the Middle East and Africa is fragile. People have difficult lives but can see via mobile phones that life in the West and in Europe is quite different. So I understand why they would like our life, our kind of standards. But it s not sustainable to integrate so many. Why not? Norway, with its oil-generated trillion-dollar sovereign wealth fund, is one of the world s richest countries   and hardly beset by integration issues. This, she says, is because they ve been careful.  Many of the jobs here today perhaps will not be here tomorrow. Working in supermarkets for example   those kinds of jobs that don t need higher education. Those who come to Norway without any education   what are they going to do in the future if this continues? The case for limiting economic migration is clear. But about half of the registered asylum seekers in the EU, last year were from countries that were struck by conflict. Can Norway justify taking so few? Ms. Listhaug is a practicing Christian (albeit skeptical of the  thoroughly socialist  Church of Norway) and says her government s immigration policy, when combined with its aid policy, is not just a moral response, but the most effective moral response. For me it s a moral issue as well. You can t just help the ones you see. You have to think about the millions you don t see and that have a very difficult life in the world. She s referring to the refugee camps in Jordan, where both Norway and the UK send aid to help those displaced by war. Norway gave  23 million to its Jordanian mission last year, almost twice as much, per capita, as Britain. The cost of helping refugees at home is taken from its foreign aid budget, so as its influx subsides and costs fall, all savings are used to help refugees abroad. Some  370 million has been transferred so far, with more expected next year.So to Ms. Listhaug, it s not a question of whether to help refugees, but how best to do so. We meet after she visited Brandon Lewis, her British counterpart, who gave her a striking statistic:  The immigration minister here in Britain said that for the price of helping 3,000 young people here, he could help 100,000 children in other parts of the world. She sees this as a modern way to help asylum seekers   and more practical than the 1951 UN Refugee Convention, which obliges signatories to accommodate anyone with a  well-founded fear of persecution . It was an agreement for its time,  she says.  But when people travel through 20 countries to come to a safe haven, I think people can see that this is not right. You could have a safe haven in your neighboring country, so why go so far? Western countries that define their virtue by the number of refugees they let in, she says, also face a moral question:  Why should we have a system that works for the people who have money [to pay for the journey] while the rest of the refugees and people in need don t have the money to go? People traffickers, she says, thrive on governments that follow the old rules and accept those who turn up on their shores.  If you smuggle an unaccompanied minor from Afghanistan to Europe, they say it is between $3,000 and $20,000.  Young girls, she says, are sometimes sold to old men to finance such a journey.  Also, children are killed, or raped, on their way. So we need to have this under control. Ms Listhaug provoked fury in Sweden a few weeks ago by visiting a suburb in Stockholm notorious for unrest among its young immigrant population. She called it a  no-go zone    a phrase that the Swedes angrily reject. But she doesn t seem to mind causing a fuss, especially as she thinks her critics are coming around to her way of thinking. Nor does she mind using Sweden as a case study in what not to do.  A lot of countries in Europe are thinking more like us: like Denmark and Austria. Germany, as well  France has big problems right now with integration, as does Belgium. A lot of countries in Europe see that we need to have this under control. The Norwegian model, she says, is very different and very clear.  If you are an economic migrant, you are declined in Norway,  she says.  We send people back to Afghanistan if they are not in need of protection; we send them back to Somalia if they are not in need of protection.  Isn t this a rather expensive process?  Yes, but it s well worth it.  Police are also sent out to areas where illegal immigrants are suspected of living and working.  If we find them, we send them out. That has also decreased crime in Norway, that s very good. I ask Listhaug if she is getting used to being called cruel and heartless. How does it make her feel? Her response comes quickly:  I don t give a damn,  she says. She thinks her approach is right, and the consensus is wrong. And, as she says, an increasing number of other countries think the same. A new consensus might well be in the making.  SpectatorUKSo what do her neighbors in Sweden think of her tough positions on asylum seekers? The Swedish resident in the video below has nothing but praise for Listhaug. He openly praises her while mocking the  lefties  who have allowed out-of-control migration to destroy much of Sweden. In the video below, he reminds Swedes of the startling crime statistics they are facing: In Sweden, we have 10 times more car torchings. Do you want this? We have 4 times more violent killings than Norway. Is that what you want? Well, you should listen to your lefties, and be more like Sweden, It s interesting, the migration minister Sylvi Listhaug, came to Sweden to find out for herself, she wanted to find out what not to do in Norway.

"German police raid places linked to suspected Islamist militant, seize guns. BERLIN (Reuters) - German police seized large quantities of guns and ammunition in raids on four locations in Berlin linked to a 40-year-old German man with suspected Islamist ties, the Berlin prosecutor s office said on Wednesday.  The man, a German citizen with a Turkish background, had previously been convicted of weapons violations, and frequented a mosque which was under surveillance by state security, said prosecutor spokeswoman Silke Becker. Germany was hit by several Islamist militant attacks in 2016, including one in Berlin in December in which a Tunisian man shot dead a Polish lorry driver and then killed 11 more people by driving the stolen truck into a Christmas market. Germany s domestic intelligence agency has warned of further attacks by radicalised Muslims, given growing numbers of foreign fighters returning from war zones in Syria and Iraq. [L2N1MU194] Becker said an investigation had been under way since summer, but the raids were triggered by concerns that the suspect could harm his family rather than any specific indication of a planned terrorist attack.   It became clear that the suspect could have an Islamist background and Islamist connection in the broadest sense,  she said.  The suspect was due to go before a judge on Wednesday. ",0,en

"Stop meddling in foreign elections, UK's Johnson tells Russian hosts. MOSCOW (Reuters) - British foreign minister Boris Johnson told his Russian counterpart on Friday there was  abundant evidence  of Moscow meddling in foreign elections, but said any Russian efforts to interfere in last year s Brexit referendum had fallen flat.  On the first visit to Russia by a British foreign minister in five years, Johnson said he wanted to normalize UK-Russia relations, which were going through  a very difficult patch . But that didn t mean pretending that Britain did not have serious concerns about Russia s behavior, he said.    ... We can t pretend that they (the problems) do not exist, and that we share a common perspective on the events in Ukraine, or in the Western Balkans or ... on Russian activities in cyberspace,  said Johnson. He also said Britain had a duty to speak up for the LGBT community in Chechnya. Two men from Chechnya told Reuters in June they had been tortured because they were gay. Chechen authorities deny the allegations. Johnson s visit comes at a time when relations between London and Moscow are strained by differences over Ukraine and Syria as well as by allegations, which Russia flatly denies, that Moscow has meddled in the politics of various European countries by backing cyber attacks and disinformation campaigns. Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov challenged that narrative, however, saying Johnson himself had recently said he had no proof that Moscow had meddled in last year s British referendum on leaving the European Union.   Not successfully, not successfully, I think is the word,  Johnson   a leading advocate of Brexit   shot back, to which Lavrov replied:  He s scared that if he doesn t disagree with me, his reputation will be ruined at home.  Johnson, who said there was abundant evidence of Russian election meddling in Germany, the United States and other countries, said it was Lavrov s reputation he was worried about.  I think it is very important ... to recognize that Russian attempts to interfere in our elections or in our referendum, whatever they may have been, they ve not been successful,  said Johnson.  Lavrov said he blamed Britain for the poor state of relations, complaining about  insulting and aggressive statements  from London. He also complained about Britain airing its differences with Moscow publicly rather than in private. But although the two men spent much of their joint news conference exchanging barbs, both sounded upbeat when it came to trying to cooperate in narrow areas, such as in the U.N. Security Council, and on security arrangements for next year s soccer World Cup in Russia. Lavrov complained, however, that Britain was still not fully cooperating with Russia s FSB security service.   Johnson had riled Russian officials before his visit by telling Britain s Sunday Times newspaper that Moscow was  closed, nasty, militaristic and anti-democratic . But when asked about the comment on Friday, he rowed back, saying he had been referring to the Soviet Union, not modern Russia. Russian media has portrayed Johnson as anti-Russian. Johnson told reporters on Friday however that he was  a committed Russophile .     ",0,en

In other words, while few are measuring, Harry Potter fans are a pretty big voting bloc   and they don t like Donald Trump at all.Ironically, the study was done by Donald Trump s alma mater, the University of Pennsylvania. The hatred for Trump by Harry Potter readers went beyond party lines and even age or religion. Why the visceral distaste for the Republican nominee? Because he reminds them of the books  villain, Lord Voldemort. I think a lot of the identification of Trump s dominating kind of politics is something people associate with Voldemort,  she told TIME.  So it makes some sense that if you have been exposed to these long series of books where he is the ultimate kind of incarnation of evil, that the characteristics that are more aggressive tactics and so forth that Trump represents are less attractive, even leaving aside how it affects your policy attitudes. It s not exactly surprising. Harry Potter s author, J.K. Rowling, has been a vocal critic of Trump. In this tweet, she compared him to her villain:How horrible. Voldemort was nowhere near as bad. https://t.co/hFO0XmOpPH  J.K. Rowling (@jk_rowling) December 8, 2015The Harry Potter series has long been criticized by Christian Republicans (is there another kind anymore?). It deals in witchcraft, which is  sinful  according to many Christians. Since the books first hit the shelves, there has been a small but vocal movement to ban them. The people calling for the bans, we can only guess, are likely some of today s Trump voters.Beyond the stories of sorcery, Harry Potter books have a single message: tolerance. That message is the antithesis of the Trump campaign. The story is entertaining, people like the characters in it and the lessons it teaches are far more subtle than hitting you over the head with what kind of political candidate you should support,  she said.  They re about respect for the opposition and all kinds of things that are pro-tolerance messages. Maybe the secret to a Hillary Clinton win is to have everyone read Harry Potter before the election.Featured image via Pexels.",1,en

" Trump Told Police Union To Report Cops Who Didn’t Vote For Him And It’s Uncomfortable As Hell (VIDEO). On Tuesday, our resident Manchurian couch potato met with the head of Chicago s Fraternal Order of Police to talk about the  carnage  (as Trump calls it) in the city that prompted Trump to  send in the feds  in January. Sadly, our police are often prevented from doing their jobs,  Trump told union officials at the meeting.  In too many of our communities, violent crime is on the rise. These are painful realities that many in Washington don t want to talk about. We have seen it all over. Trump thanked the union president Dean Angelo for the support he and the union gave during the campaign and, as is custom, took a moment to tell them how much cops love him, describing the numbers in his favor among law enforcement as  extremely lopsided. Then, he said something that would be taken as a joke when uttered by most people   but not by someone who installs people in various government offices to serve as loyalty police: I m just trying to figure out the few people who voted the other way. Who are they? Who are they? Find out who they are, please, and let us know. The room filled with uncertain, muffled, uneasy laughter.Was Trump joking? Who knows? After all, ever since he came to power he has treated the act of firing and threatening anyone who disagrees with him as a regular, everyday activity.Watch this extremely uncomfortable moment below:Featured image via Chicago Tribune",1,en

"TRUMP GETS HAMMERED [Video] For Not Condemning Question At Town Hall About Muslim Training Camps In US…But He Was Right…And Here’s The Proof. Yeah, because taking Trump down is more important to these flame throwers on the left (and right) than exposing the truth about Obama s  overt allegiance to Muslims living in America and the actual Muslim training camps that are taking place across America right now.Donald Trump pulled out of a Republican gathering in South Carolina Friday as he took hits from members of both parties for failing to correct a questioner who said President Obama is a Muslim. Mr. Trump has a significant business transaction that was expected to close Thursday. Due to the delay he is unable to attend today s Heritage Action Presidential Forum,  Trump s campaign announced in a release Friday.Trump had been scheduled to join most of the Republican field at the meeting of the influential conservative group.Trump drew condemnation Friday from some of his rivals for his failure to confront the questioner at a New Hampshire town hall who had labeled the president a Muslim, asked what he would do to  get rid  of Muslims and mentioned Islamic  training camps. New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie told NBC Friday,  I wouldn t have permitted that. If someone brought that up at a town hall meeting of mine, I would ve said,  No, listen. Before we answer, let s clear some things up for the rest of the audience. And I think you have an obligation as a leader to do that. If that person had been in my event I would have called him out in it,  Hillary Clinton said at a press conference after a campaign event in New Hampshire. Not only is it out of place and wrong it is totally factually untrue.  Sen. Bernie Sanders demanded that Trump apologize for  continuing the lie that the president is not an American and not a Christian. FOX News   Hidden in a remote area off a primitive dirt road lies a mysterious 70-acre compound in which more than 100 Muslims live in seclusion, following the teachings of its founder, a radical cleric with alleged ties to terrorism.It s neither a Taliban stronghold outside Jalalabad, nor an extremist madrassa on the outskirts of Karachi.It s a place called Islamberg, a closed and seemingly quiet community at the foot of the Catskill Mountains in upstate New York, about three hours north of Manhattan.It s also a compound shrouded in local rumors, mystery   and fear   sitting near the huge reservoir system that provides New York City with most of its drinking water.Quietly nestled in the woods, Islamberg remained unnoticed for the two decades leading up to Sept. 11, 2001, when the World Trade Center and the Pentagon were attacked by a determined band of Islamic extremists.That s when people started questioning the community s ties to a Pakistani cleric allegedly connected to worldwide terrorism. They also started talking about the unusual sounds of gunfire and explosions some said they heard emanating from the compound.But before you leap to conclusions and head to the Catskills to personally fight the war on terror   you need to know the entire story. The truth, as is often the case, is a lot more complicated than the headlines suggest.Islamberg got its start about 20 years ago, when   inspired by the words of the Sufi cleric Sheikh Syed Mubarik Ali Shah Gilani   a group of primarily black Muslims from Brooklyn left New York City to escape crime, poverty and racism. Aiming to lead what they believed was a peaceful and holy Muslim life, they built a community of some 40 family houses, their own grocery store and a bookstore.And they weren t alone. Other groups, also inspired by Gilani, have set up similiar communities in 19 other states. According to the group s own Web site, the Islamberg community is still  struggling,  and is asking for donations to complete its mosque.According to locals, the land previously belonged to a Deposit, N.Y., woman who opened up her home in the in the late 1970s or early  80s to disadvantaged youths from the city so that they could avoid being led astray by a financially and morally bankrupt urban environment.Those boys, according to locals who were friendly with some of the group, eventually went on to form Islamberg, and at some point they were joined by another group of more militant Muslims, who created something of a rival faction within the community.The group lived quietly there for years with little interaction with the local communities except for forays into town for supplies or to sell baked goods at the weekly flea market. Some of the men had jobs at a local credit-processing center or working for the Port Authority in New York City (where they are said to maintain a residence near a bridge that runs between two boroughs).In the few instances when they did have relationships with the locals, they were almost always friendly, many said. Sometimes local children would visit their friends in the compound. There was a sense of camaraderie with them,  one woman said.Watch video here:There was a notable exception, a situation involving the local schools in the late 1990s when some of the Islamberg boys got into a scuffle with local boys. They broke my nephew s nose,  said a Hancock, N.Y., woman, who asked that her name not be used.Another man said the Muslim boys  trashed  the school in Deposit.Locals variously blamed the fighting on an angry attitude on the part of the Muslim boys, racism on the part of the local boys or the  usual  relatively trivial events that lead almost all teenage boys into a confrontation at one point or another in their lives.According to Joy Felber, 62, a retired taxidermist who s lived in Deposit for 19 years, the cause lay with a group of local boys who picked a fight with the Muslims. We had some young boys in town who were causing trouble   not from the Muslim community   but they were antagonizing the boys in the Muslim community,  Felber said.  It was lack of knowledge. When people don t know other people, they have a tendency to lash out. And you put two teenage boys together and sparks fly. After a further controversy about whether the Islamberg boys should have been going to public school in Deposit or Hancock (the compound lies on the border between the two towns, and even longtime residents differ on whether it s technically in Deposit, Hancock or nearby Tompkins), the boys were pulled from the schools and the Muslim community drew away from town life.All Islamberg children are now schooled on the compound in a school that, according to one report, has a total of 62 students.",1,en

"Trump will not visit DMZ during Asia trip -official.  (This version of the October 31st story corrects date of Trump s visit to Asia to November 5 in 8th paragraph) WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. President Donald Trump will not go to the heavily fortified demilitarized zone (DMZ) on the border of North Korea and South Korea during his Asia trip, a senior administration official said on Tuesday.  The president is not going to visit the DMZ. There is not enough time in the schedule,  the official told reporters in a background briefing.  Instead, Trump will be the first American president to visit Camp Humphreys, a military installation south of the South Korean capital of Seoul.   We thought that would make more sense in terms of its messaging, in terms of the chance to address families and troops there,  the official said. U.S. Defense Secretary Jim Mattis visited the demilitarized zone that divides the Korean Peninsula last week and Vice President Mike Pence made the same trip in April.  The official, speaking on customary condition of anonymity in briefing reporters, noted the two Trump administration forays to the zone.  It s becoming a little bit of a cliche, frankly,  the official said. Trump leaves for his first trip to Asia this week and is expected to arrive on November 5 in Tokyo.  Separately, two U.S. officials said a decision may be made for the three aircraft carriers currently in the Asia Pacific region to carry out an exercise to coincide with Trump s trip. The officials said no decision had been made, but it would be the first exercise with three U.S. aircraft carriers in the region since 2007. A senior State Department official, speaking on the condition of anonymity, said the buildup of naval forces was part of the military component of the Trump administration s strategy to put  maximum pressure  on North Korea, which includes sanctions and diplomatic isolation. Earlier on Tuesday, the State Department welcomed a decision by China and South Korea to resume normal ties after a year-long standoff over a decision by Seoul and Washington to deploy a missile defense system to counter North Korea s nuclear program.

"No U.S.-Russia cyber unit without Trump notifying Congress, bill says. (Reuters) - U.S. President Donald Trump would be required to notify U.S. lawmakers before creating a joint U.S.-Russia cyber security unit - an idea that has drawn criticism across the political spectrum - under legislation advancing in Congress.  The proposal, if it became law, would be the latest in a series of maneuvers by Congress that either limit the president’s authority on Russia matters or rebuke his desire to warm relations with Moscow. A provision contained within the annual Intelligence Authorization Act and passed by the U.S. Senate Intelligence Committee 14-1 would require the Trump administration to provide Congress with a report describing what intelligence would be shared with Russia, any counterintelligence concerns and how those concerns would be addressed. The bill, which grants congressional approval for clandestine operations carried out by the CIA and other U.S. intelligence agencies, passed the Senate Intelligence Committee in July, but its text was only recently made public because it involves sensitive intelligence operations.     Trump last month said on Twitter that he and Russian President Vladimir Putin had discussed establishing “an impenetrable Cyber Security unit” to address issues like the risk of cyber meddling in elections. Trump quickly backpedaled on the idea, which was criticized by Democrats, senior Republicans and the National Security Agency director. The White House and Senator Richard Burr, the Republican chairman of the intelligence panel, were not immediately available for comment on the bill. Trump wants to improve relations with Russia, a desire that has been hamstrung by the conclusions of U.S. intelligence agencies that Russia interfered in the 2016 presidential election to help Republican Trump against Democrat Hillary Clinton.  U.S. congressional panels and a special counsel are investigating the interference and possible collusion between Russia and members of Trump’s campaign. Moscow has denied any meddling and Trump has denied any collusion. Previously, Congress tied the president’s hands on Russia by passing a bill that Trump cannot ease the sanctions against Russia unless he seeks congressional approval. In August, the Senate blocked Trump from being able to make recess appointments while lawmakers were on break, fearing the president would fire Attorney General Jeff Sessions over his handling of the Russian probe. Lawmakers have also introduced legislation to stop Trump from having the ability to fire Robert Mueller, the special counsel appointed to determine whether there was collusion between Trump’s 2016 presidential campaign and Moscow. The annual Intelligence Authorization Act requires approval by the full Senate and House and the president’s signature before it can become law. No vote has been scheduled and the last act was passed by Congress in March.  The legislation’s provision requiring notification of any U.S.-Russia cybersecurity unit was pushed by Democratic Senator Ron Wyden, his office said on Tuesday. Wyden also helped secure provisions in the bill that call for an intelligence report assessing the threat posed to the United States by Russian money laundering and another report examining whether cyber vulnerabilities in U.S. cell networks, including a known bug in the global mobile network Signaling System No. 7, or SS7, are being exploited by foreign governments to conduct surveillance on Americans. Wyden was the lone committee vote against the bill, however.  He said in a statement on Tuesday that he objected to language that identified the anti-secrecy group WikiLeaks as a “non-state hostile intelligence service” because doing so could have implications for journalists. (This version of the story was refiled to correct “conclusion” to “collusion” in paragraph 9) ",0,en

"Police charge Czech PM candidate Babis with subsidy fraud. PRAGUE (Reuters) - Andrej Babis, the frontrunner to become Czech prime minister after this month s election, said on Monday he had been formally charged with fraud in a case involving a 2 million euro EU subsidy a decade ago. Babis has repeatedly denied any wrongdoing, saying the investigation was a plot by adversaries who want to prevent him from taking power and cutting corruption links between the EU member country s incumbent politicians and business.   I have received a decision on the commencement of criminal prosecution in the pseudo-case ... I immediately appealed this decision,  Babis said in a text message through his spokeswoman. Spokesmen for the Prague prosecutor and police were not immediately available for comment. The charges were expected after police asked parliament in August to lift parliamentary immunity of the billionaire businessman Babis, leader of the ANO movement, and ANO deputy chief Jaroslav Faltynek. Parliament voted to allow prosecution on Sept 6. The ANO spokeswoman said Faltynek, former executive at companies owned by Babis, had also been charged with fraud. He also denies wrongdoing. Babis is almost certain to win a new parliamentary mandate in the Oct 20-21 vote, which would renew his immunity. Parliament would have to vote again to lift it to allow the prosecution to go ahead.  ANO is expected to win the most votes in the election but fall short of an overall majority in parliament. Several potential coalition parties have said they would not join a government led by Babis personally due to the investigation.  The case involves an allegation that Babis hid ownership a decade ago of the farm and conference center, Capi hnizdo (Stork Nest), so it would qualify for a European Union subsidy that was meant for small businesses. It would not qualify as part of Babis s Agrofert group of companies which is the largest private employer in the central European country. Babis said it was owned by his family members when the subsidy was awarded. It was folded into Agrofert later. Babis and Faltynek, a former executive at Agrofert companies, face potential prison sentences if the case is brought to court and if they are found guilty. The Slovak-born Babis moved Agrofert and other assets into trust funds earlier this year to meet new conflict of interest legislation. He remains beneficiary of the funds. Apart from police, the European Union s anti-fraud unit OLAF has also been looking into the case. ",0,en

" Hillary Gives Rubio A New Name After He Says She Kills Babies On Their Due Date (VIDEO). Marco Rubio is making a name for himself in the Republican Party. Some think (actually most) that he s the GOP s best chance to defeat the Democrats in a general election. He s young, he s Hispanic, he s from an important swing state like Florida, and he s not as crazy as Donald Trump (at least by appearance).But, what most people don t know, is that Rubio s views on abortion make him an absolute nightmare of a candidate. And, people within his own party even are calling him out on it. During Saturday night s Republican debate Senator Rubio made the craziest accusation against Hillary Clinton on abortion yet. He levied the charge that  Hillary supports aborting babies on their due date. When Hillary was asked on Face The Nation what she thought of the comment, here was how she described it, among other words: Pathetic. That s one way to describe Rubio, for sure.We can t say these kinds of attacks are not typical of Republicans, cause then we d be lying. Hillary wasn t even surprised in the least and didn t even flinch when offering her rebuttal.  Here was her full response: I think it s pretty pathetic. This is something that illustrates how Senator Rubio is going as far as he can to try and buttress his credentials within certain parts of the Republican constituency. I ve been on record for years of where I stand on making abortion safe and legal, the exceptions that are appropriate that should be looked into, and the very difficult choices that very few women have to confront that lead to very excruciating kinds of decisions. And, to begin to politicize this so early in the campaign season to try and raise false charges and look like he s going to try and make sure Roe v. Wade is overturned and Planned Parenthood is defunded is just a tried and true tactic by those on the right. Clinton followed this up by pointing out that Rubio should probably brush up on the law first before bringing this up again in the future.Senator Rubio may very well be the GOP s best chance to go up against the Democrats, but with comments like those in a debate, you can be sure Clinton will be ready to shut him down again if she has to. We rate her description of Rubio as  pathetic  to be accurate and right on the money. Featured image via screen capture.",1,en
"OOPS! MEDIA LIED…Transgender Surgery For Military Members Cost Taxpayers A LOT More Than #FakeNews Is Telling Americans. Liz Harrington, a writer for the Washington Free Beacon  appeared on the Tucker Carlson Show to discuss the real cost of sex reassignment surgery for transgenders in the military. Harrington debunked the fake numbers the media s been peddling to the American public about the cost of the sex assignment surgeries, in an effort to discredit President Trump s decision to ban transgenders serving in the military. It turns out the media hasn t been exactly honest about actual cost of allowing transgenders to serve in our military. The media s been saying the costs are only a few million per year, but according to Harrington, the actual estimated cost is more like $1.3 billion to taxpayers over a 10 year period. Additionally, the military members who have these surgeries take an estimated 238 days off to recover.As a side note, the $1.3 billion cost to taxpayers doesn t even include the very costly hormone treatments that transgenders in the military will need following the costly surgeries.The Washington Post has done their part to mislead the American public about the cost of transgenders serving in our military. They re not interested in taking an honest look at the costs to the American taxpayer. For the media, this issue has nothing to do with the cost to American taxpayers or with our national security. It s simple a matter of political correctness. And for The Washington Post, who Americans used to rely on for actual news, political correctness trumps truth every time.The Washington Post published an article on July 26th titled that supposedly addressed the cost of transgenders in the military. Instead, the article was written and titled to reinforce a false narrative that our president is a  homophobe , a  racist  and a  misogynist .Trump s argument against transgender soldiers echoes one used against gays, women and blacksHere is a portion of their article:Seemingly out of the blue on Wednesday morning, President Trump took to Twitter to announce that he would not allow  Transgender individuals to serve in any capacity in the U.S. Military.  The rationale? The military  cannot be burdened with the tremendous medical costs and disruption that transgender in the military would entail. The question of costs   presumably referring to procedures like gender reassignment surgery   was addressed in a Rand report that estimated a 0.04- to 0.13-percent increase in military health-care expenditures should transgender people be allowed to serve. Trump has proposed a 10 percent bump in overall military spending, which could certainly absorb that increase.Can anyone explain why members of Congress would vote to increase spending on our military that would then be used for sex reassignment surgery for transgenders serving in our military? What in the world does sex reassignment have to do with defending our nation? ",1,en
" It’s On: GOP Chairman Just Declared WAR On Trump With This Tweet. Leading Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump has been bashing party leaders for several days after rival Ted Cruz has successfully maneuvered himself into securing several delegates. As Trump sees it, its unfair and undemocratic for Cruz to obtain delegates via state party meetings, arcane rules governing who receives delegates from primaries and the like.As a result, Trump has been loudly whining to the media.During an exclusive interview with The Hill at Trump Tower, Trump said,  It s a disgrace for the party. And Reince Priebus should be ashamed of himself. He should be ashamed of himself because he knows what s going on. Trump is furious with several aspects of the Republican nominating process, including how Colorado recently awarded all of its 34 delegates to Sen. Ted Cruz (R-Texas) without having a primary or a caucus. He doesn t agree that some delegates aren t bound to vote for their state or district winner at this summer s GOP convention in Cleveland. It should go to a vote in Colorado like other places.   The best way to do it would be just a vote, should be a vote of the people. That s the way it should be done. The delegate situation is a very unjust way of doing things. After months of sucking it up, RNC Chairman Reince Priebus finally spoke up, releasing a tweet that   without naming any names   ridiculed the argument that Trump has been making.Nomination process known for a year + beyond. It's the responsibility of the campaigns to understand it. Complaints now? Give us all a break  Reince Priebus (@Reince) April 13, 2016With those few words, Priebus gives establishment oxygen to the so-called #NeverTrump movement. The party does not want Trump to get the nomination, as he loses to both Hillary Clinton and Bernie Sanders with double-digit percentages, while also he has already become a drag on down-ballot House and Senate races.The tweet shows that they may be willing to use every obscure party rule at their disposal at the convention in Cleveland in order to knock Trump off the ballot and turn to a candidate like Cruz, John Kasich, or even Mitt Romney, in order to stop a likely loss of the presidential election from becoming a complete bloodbath for the Republican Party.At the same time, Trump has shadowy figures in his corner like Republican dirty trickster Roger Stone and conspiracy theorist radio host Alex Jones, who already plan to protest in Cleveland, and have proposed a plan to confront delegates in their hotel rooms in order to keep pro-Trump votes in line.Featured image via Flickr",1,en

"Air strikes kill 69 in Syrian east since Sunday: Observatory. BEIRUT (Reuters) - The Syrian Observatory for Human Rights said air strikes likely to have been carried out by Russian warplanes have killed 69 people since Sunday near the Euphrates River in the eastern Syrian province of Deir al-Zor. The Russian defense ministry did not immediately respond to a Reuters request for comment on Tuesday s report by the Britain-based monitoring group. The Observatory, which identified the victims as civilians, said the air strikes hit civilian encampments on the western bank of the Euphrates and vessels crossing the river to the eastern side. Separately, Syrian state television said on Tuesday Islamic State militants have been using the river to flee the city of Deir al-Zor. With heavy artillery and machineguns, the Syrian army struck rafts carrying militants and crossing the Euphrates to the eastern side, it reported. Islamic State s  only escape route out of the city is through rafts on the river, and, God willing, we will target them in the water before they get away,  a field commander in Deir al-Zor told state TV.

"Australia's former deputy PM wins by-election in coalition boost. SYDNEY (Reuters) - Australia s former deputy prime minister Barnaby Joyce cleared the way for his return to parliament on Saturday, winning a by-election just over a month after he was kicked out over a dual citizenship crisis that cost the government its majority.  Joyce was not only returned in his New England seat in New South Wales but was forecast to have lifted his primary vote by at least 10 points, giving Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull a welcome boost after a tough few weeks.   This has been a stunning victory,  Turnbull told supporters as he joined Joyce at a pub in the town of Tamworth. Exit polls were predicting  the largest swing to the government in the history of by-elections in Australia , Turnbull said, adding it was a vindication of his coalition.  We re getting the band back together.  Joyce was one of the  Citizenship Seven  whose eligibility to sit in parliament was thrown into doubt when it was found they were dual citizens, a status that is barred for politicians under Australia s constitution to prevent split allegiances. The High Court ruled on Oct. 27 that Joyce, along with four of the seven other lawmakers, was ineligible to remain in parliament, forcing a by-election. Joyce was found to be a dual citizen of New Zealand, a status he has since rescinded.  The deputy leader position, traditionally held by a member of the junior coalition partner, the National Party, had remained vacant since the High Court ruling. The result comes at a difficult time for Turnbull, who earlier this week reversed his long-held opposition to a full-blown inquiry into the country s scandal-hit financial sector amid mounting political pressure. Turnbull has also seen a splinter within his center right Liberal-National coalition over same-sex marriage, with the conservative faction, led by some of the Nationals, angered by his promise to push through legislation after an historic public vote in favor of the unions.  The last day of campaigning for the by-election was marred by a call from New South Wales Nationals state leader and deputy premier John Barilaro for Turnbull to step down as a  Christmas gift  to the nation. The comments were quickly rebuffed by Liberal Party lawmakers and Joyce, who said they were  very unhelpful  and  insulting.    ",0,en
"German liberals would expect finance ministry in Merkel coalition. BERLIN (Reuters) - Germany s Free Democrats (FDP) would want the finance ministry in exchange for joining Chancellor Angela Merkel in the country s next coalition government, a member of the party s executive said. Setting out conditions days before federal elections that Merkel is almost certain to win, albeit short of an absolute majority, the FDP also ruled out partnering her conservatives if she supported French plans to deepen fiscal integration in the euro zone. Often viewed as Merkel s natural allies, the socially liberal FDP were part of her second government from 2009 to 2013. They crashed out of parliament that year but are hoping to re-enter the legislature on Sunday as the third-largest party. Current Finance Minister Wolfgang Schaeuble, of Merkel s Christian Democrats (CDU), has held the post since 2009 and is the most high-profile member of her cabinet. But Alexander Hahn, a member of the FDP s national executive, said the ministry should go to someone from his party.  The FDP should enter no government in which it cannot name a finance minister,  Hahn told mass-market daily Bild in remarks published on Monday. On Sunday, FDP leader Christian Lindner said setting the agenda for Europe was the most important issue for his party in any coalition talks with the conservatives after the Sept. 24 vote.  I fear that Ms Merkel has already agreed to new funding mechanisms (for the EU) with (French President Emmanuel) Macron,  he told the Welt am Sonntag newspaper.   Everything that goes in the direction of financial transfer on the European level, be it a euro zone budget or a banking union, is a red line for us . Macron, who is to present his views on the future of the euro zone on Sept. 26, has called for a finance minister and a standalone budget for the bloc, while European Commission chief Jean-Claude Juncker on Wednesday urged EU governments to use economic recovery as a springboard toward closer union. Merkel has said she would work with Macron on strengthening the euro zone. But Germany remains insistent that member states should take primary responsibility for their own economic problems, a principle whose prime exponent has been Schaeuble. He is revered by a significant part of the conservative voter base who see him as a guardian of their austerity-oriented interests in the euro zone. The FDP, who held the foreign minister in their last union with the conservatives, have reinvented themselves under Lindner, who preaches a hard line on Europe. They are polling 8 to 10 percent in surveys, while Merkel s conservatives are on around 37 percent, leaving their combined forces just short of a majority. Analysts say completing a banking union and creating a euro zone budget would provide more stability for the currency bloc, and that a conservative/FDP coalition might threaten such plans.  I fear there could be a strong reaction on bond markets should the FDP push for a literal enforcement of fiscal rules or for an expulsion of Greece as part of a future ruling coalition,  said Martin Lueck of asset manager BlackRock. A grand coalition with the centre-left Social Democrats (SPD), Merkel s current partners and polling around 23 percent, would make it much easier for the chancellor to work with Macron on overhauling the euro zone. The centre-left SPD have often criticized Schaeuble s tough stance on Greece and have even backed the idea of common euro zone debt. The FDP are fighting for third spot against the anti-immigrant Alternative for Germany (AfD), which is forecast to enter parliament for the first time. ",0,en

" Ted Cruz Has A Sickening New Plan For America’s Muslims And It’s Even Worse Than Trump’s. If ever there was a reminder that Sen. Ted Cruz is NOT the Republican Party s reasonable  alternative to Donald Trump, it s in his response to the Brussels terror attacks. Losing badly to Trump, Cruz is clearly feeling the pressure to capitalize on the tragedy to win some crucial votes   so he s gone all in on xenophobia, totalitarianism, and religious persecution. A hate cocktail sure to fire up his base.In a statement he released on Facebook, Cruz calls for the establishment of ghettos where America s Muslims can be contained and watched over by a specialized law enforcement group meant to police them. If that sounds a little to  Nazi-esque  for you, Cruz preemptively accused his critics of just being too  politically correct  to agree with him.Here s Cruz s terrifying vision for his presidency:We need to immediately halt the flow of refugees from countries with a significant al Qaida or ISIS presence.We need to empower law enforcement to patrol and secure Muslim neighborhoods before they become radicalized.We need to secure the southern border to prevent terrorist infiltration.And we need to execute a coherent campaign to utterly destroy ISIS.In other words, Cruz is plagiarizing Trump s  ban all Muslims  position, but adding that the Muslims already in the country should be  secured  in specific neighborhoods  before they become radicalized.  He doesn t bother clarifying how he would hope to accomplish this. Nor does he mention how he could legally target Muslims who had done nothing wrong just because his prejudice tells him they might some day.Being  Lying Ted  Cruz, he also couldn t help but spread a little misinformation about President Obama as well. Using the president s historic trip to Cuba as a strawman, Cruz bashed him for being on a diplomatic trip while Brussels was attacked, adding that Obama never visited Paris after the terror attacks there. It was an egregious lie, so shameless that a simple picture could debunk it.#COP21 Paying respect : President Obama & French President Hollande lay flowers at Bataclan concert hall in Paris. pic.twitter.com/YEMy7ZUDvk  Catherine Field (@CatherineField) November 30, 2015Needless to say, Muslim activist groups, who have watched in horror as hate crimes directed at Muslim Americans has steadily grown thanks to people like Cruz, were not amused by this latest call to trounce the Constitution based on hate and fear. It s really beyond belief that you have one of the leading presidential candidates calling for law enforcement to target religious communities totally based on the fact that they are of a particular faith,  CAIR spokesman Ibrahim Hooper said by phone.  In normal times, this would be the sort of thing that would disqualify someone from running for dogcatcher, much less president of the United States. We call on voters to reject this.Undoubtedly, terrorism is a serious problem. But the solutions to it need to be much more mature than the Republicans seem to want to believe. Totalitarianism doesn t work   and never has. Discriminating against innocent Muslims because of a twisted death cult based in the Middle East is not only doomed to fail, but could backfire in ways that Cruz and Trump can t fathom from their  build a wall  childish ideology.Between Ted Cruz and Donald Trump, it s hard to say who the bigger xenophobic bigot is. Both are consumed by a hatred towards scapegoated groups they hope to exploit in order to ensure people vote for them. At this point in the race, the two Republican frontrunners aren t just mirroring each other s disgusting policies, but actually driving one another to make them more abhorrent. A nuclear arms race of bigotry in a crucial moment in America s history.Featured image via screenshot",1,en

"HOW HILLARY CLINTON Has Secured Her Husband’s Legacy As “A Rapist” And Hers As An “Enabler” [VIDEO]. Hillary Clinton is a professional panderer. There is no vote she won t attempt to secure, no matter the cost. In reality, her desire to gain the vote of young women in America will only harm her, as her call to stop the sexual assaults against women on campuses across America only shines a light one of the ugliest aspects of the Clinton Crime Syndicate. Bill s pattern of sexual abuse, and Hillary s willingness to sit back and watch will undoubtedly to come back to haunt them. Anyone who thought Hillary could get away with this phony compassion for women who are truly sexual victims, underestimates the disdain that women on both sides of the aisle have for her and her serial rapist husband.Articles have now appeared in two left of center websites, VOX and Slate, noting that it s hard to dismiss Ms. (Anita) Broderick (claims of sexual assault by Bill Clinton) given the new progressive consensus on believing victims. Well the injunction to believe victims gained currency among progressives because of a potent mix of gender theory and advocacy statistics.The theory came from the legal scholar Catharine MacKinnon, who taught that: Feminism is built on believing women s accounts of sexual use and abuse and by men.  The statistics were supplied by activist researchers who claimed that women almost never lie about sexual assault. Now those activist statistics have been shredded, but among progressives, the doctrine of sexual victim infallibility, that lived on. But if victims are infallible, then those they accuse, must be presumed guilty. And that brings us to the Clintons. Hillary Clinton has signed on to that theory. Watch here: ",1,en

" Breitbart Caught Praising Melania For Exact Thing They Once Viciously Smeared Michelle Obama Over. In a stunning example of just how morally bankrupt right-wing media has become in the Age of Trump, Breitbart   the conservative website often described as Trump s de facto propaganda wing   wrote a lavish piece praising Melania Trump for her  high fashion  outfits while accompanying her husband on his first overseas trip.Who cares, right? Why would anyone have a problem with what the first lady is wearing on a trip?Well, Breitbart, the very same website, seems to   albeit only when it s the African-American wife of America s first African-American president. Here s the sneering way they covered Michelle Obama s decision to wear a $3,200 dress on the former president s visit with the pope.Politico reports that First Lady Michelle Obama, looking lovely and classy, greeted Pope Francis Tuesday while wearing a $2,290 dress. While the Obamas are not Catholics, this is still a finger-in-the-eye to a White House guest who frequently speaks out   to wild Democrat applause   about the evils of excessive capitalism.And adding to the absurd critique:According to WorldVision, you can feed a child for just $35  a month. Michelle Obama s dress would feed over 80 children for that month. This choice obviously is contrary to the values of Pope Francis. But the Obamas  religious values come from elsewhere, a divisive and disturbing place, not a charitable or unifying one.Almost beyond parody.Flash forward to this weekend. Melania was treated to a photo spread, with Brietbart praising her outfits, including an expensive custom-made creation from fashion designer Dolce & Gabbana.In a visit to meet Pope Francis, Melania worked with Dolce & Gabbana, again, on a stunning custom-made, black coat-dress that showed off a beautiful round collar, framing the First Lady s face. The look was paired with a black lace Mantilla and black Manolo Blahnik stilettos, sticking to the Vatican dress code.The next day, Melania would don a dress that cost $51,000. Conservatives didn t bat an eye.Let s crunch those numbers through Breitbart s bullshit calculator:According to WorldVision, you can feed a child for just $35 a month. Melania Trump s dress would feed over 1400 children for a month. But then the Trump s religious values come from elsewhere, a divisive and disturbing place, not a charitable one. (This comparison, however tongue-in-cheek, is actually unfair in more ways than one, the Obamas actually do have a history of charitable giving. Trump is famous for not donating to charity. A truly  divisive and disturbing  worldview, if there ever was one.)As the above passages exemplify, Breitbart loved to apply ridiculous, nonsense standards to the Obamas that they would never dream of holding the Trump family up to. The website once run by anti-Semite Steve Bannon and which has a section devoted to  black crime  has some pretty obvious, bigoted reasons for hating the Obamas. It s egregious but not particularly surprising then that they would find the white first lady s opulence charming while finding the black first lady s show of class distressing.Featured image via Franco Origlia/Getty Images / h/t Mikel Jollett",1,en

" Suckers! Sarah Palin Bought This Mansion With The Money Conservatives Gave Her (PHOTOS). It pays well to be a failed right-wing candidate. Sarah Palin, who served a half term as Alaska s governor and made a halfhearted attempt to become vice president next to John McCain, has profited quite nicely from her place in the conservative universe.After losing the 2008 election, Palin quickly quit being governor of Alaska and became a pundit on Fox News Channel. She signed a book deal and pumped out several tomes (her most recent book is Sweet Freedom: A Devotional), likely ghostwritten by writers who will be forever anonymous, and set up a political action committee, SarahPAC, that went to work buying thousands of her own books   helping to send them up the bestseller charts.While her deal with Fox was ended by the network (after they built her a custom studio at her Alaska home, she rarely appeared on the network outside of goofy appearances on Sean Hannity s program), she ran an online subscription TV service for a while before that abruptly ended, and now appears on the fringe One America News Network. That network has promoted itself as the conservative alternative to Fox News, but does not have mainstream satelitte or cable tv coverage.In 2011 Palin purchased a mansion in Arizona for $1.695 million, and is now selling the property for $2.499 million. She ll make a profit on the home, thanks in part to the Obama agenda she opposed improving the economy and the real estate market.While Palin styles herself as just a hockey mom who loves her country, the 8,000 square foot home is not exactly a humble home on the range.The nearly 8,000-square-foot home was built in 2001. Some of its features include high ceilings, chandeliers and wrought-iron railings.The home also boasts a media room/theater, a wine cellar, six bedrooms and six and a half bathrooms. One of the two master suites includes a rooftop deck.The outdoor area features a built-in grill station, a fire pit, a pool, a spa, a water-saving synthetic lawn and a lighted sports court complete the more than four-acre equestrian-zoned grounds. There s also a six-car garage.The home is inside a gated community, so not just anyone can come inside to pal around with the Palins.Here s how the realtor sells the property to prospective buyers:This pristine gated estate is sure to impress as you enter from a wraparound drive to access the private gated entrance. Masterfully designed & built this 7971 sqft home showcases 6 bedrooms, 6.5 baths, a 6 car garage & breathtaking mountain views from virtually every room! Quality & care echoes throughout, with beautiful finishes, fixtures, fireplaces, chandeliers, soaring ceilings, media theater, wine cellar & more. Craftsmanship extends to the resort themed backyard with fireplaces off the covered patio, veranda & rooftop deck off of the master suite. Luxury abounds with a built-in grill station, fire-pit, sparkling blue pool, spa, synthetic grass & a lighted sports court.

"BRUTALLY HONEST BILLBOARD Turns Heads In State With Exploding Muslim Immigrant Population. American citizens should be more concerned about the Left and the leftist media s attempt to HIDE the brutal truth about Sharia in America, than a billboard that gives readers an opportunity to learn the truth.In a state that doesn t tolerate any discussion of what the massive influx of Somali refugees has done to their neighborhoods and schools, this billboard will likely be a hot topic in Minnesota. Recently, the Minnesota Governor told his constituents to  Leave the state  if they don t like the massive influx off Muslims. Watch the INCREDIBLE VIDEO HERE. [Video]A billboard of a woman in a niqab went up on I-94 in Rogers at the beginning of June, prompting calls to the sign company from the public. Copy was added to the billboard in July, which now reads  Should America Fear Sharia? The billboard is sponsored by the Center for Security Policy, a Washington, D.C. based national security think tank. The site shouldamericafearsharia.org consists mostly of links to videos discussing different topics about Islam and Islamic extremism.The billboard was contracted out by the Center with Franklin Outdoor Advertising, a billboard company in Minnesota and Wisconsin. The billboard went up the beginning of June,  Franklin salesperson Chris Barta said,  Last Friday we switched it out and put up the one with the website. The website advertisement billboard will be up from July 1st through the end of the month when the advertisement contract expires.The Center for Security Policy s website contains articles and videos on national security threats of Islamic terrorism.In the wake of the Pulse nightclub shooting in Orlando, the Center s executive vice president Jim Hanson called the attack,  completely in keeping with totalitarian Islamic code called Shariah. Franklin Outdoor Advertising received a number of calls from the public regarding the billboard according to Barta, mostly in June when there was no text accompanying the image on the sign.

" Canada’s Trudeau Throws MAJOR Shade At ‘Grizzly Bear’ Trump; It’s GLORIOUS. Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau is a diplomatic, nice guy   unlike his American counterpart, Donald Trump. While speaking on the issue of how to deal with Trump, Trudeau was able to show class and grace, while still throwing major shade at the bombastic, bumbling American president. Trudeau s low-key handling of Trump could cost him with his progressive base at home, but given Trump s penchant for retaliation, going after Trump explicitly could be harmful to Canada s economy, given the fact that they export so many products to our country.While speaking on Trump, Trudeau said: Why poke a grizzly bear while it s having lunch? Trump has just got into office and he is formulating his economic plans. This is clearly a departure from the closeness Trudeau had with President Obama. Their adorable bromance and open and affectionate friendship is surely something that will not be duplicated with Trump. Those familiar with the situation on how Trudeau may handle Trump acknowledge that no one quite knows what to do with him at this point. One source said: He is totally unpredictable. Of course, this isn t the first time Trudeau has thrown passive aggressive public punches at Trump. After Trump s Muslim ban threw the nation and world into chaos, Trudeau tweeted:To those fleeing persecution, terror & war, Canadians will welcome you, regardless of your faith. Diversity is our strength #WelcomeToCanada  Justin Trudeau (@JustinTrudeau) January 28, 2017Of course, Trudeau s reluctance to go after Trump may not last long. He is up for re-election in 2019, and will have to continue to tout his commitment to diversity and inclusion in the fact of Trump s crude nationalism and open bigotry. However, Canadian Pollster Nik Nanos says Trudeau is doing the right thing regarding Trump for now: He has to avoid making any kind of criticism. Trump has a very thin skin and he s quick to lash out. That may be, but given Trudeau s public statements regarding diversity and progressive values, he is not likely to hold off for long before he takes the gloves off regarding Trump. We ll be lucky if America has ANY friends left by the end of Trump s term.Featured image via Drew Angerer/Getty Images",1,en
"TRUMP SAYS “YES” To Federal Funding For Planned Parenthood…Under One Condition…And You’re Gonna Love It!. Sounds like a great deal, right? After all, Planned Parenthood insists that only 3% of its business involves abortions, and they get $500 million from the federal government. That way, they could focus that much more on all their work in pre-natal care! And yet  The White House, concerned about the possible political repercussions of the Republican effort to defund Planned Parenthood, has proposed preserving federal payments to the group if it discontinues providing abortions.The proposal, which was never made formally, has been rejected as an impossibility by officials at Planned Parenthood, which receives about $500 million annually in federal funding. That money helps pay for women s health services the organization provides, not for abortion services. Let s be clear: Federal funds already do not pay for abortions,  Dawn Laguens, the executive vice president of the Planned Parenthood Federation of America, said on Monday.  Offering money to Planned Parenthood to abandon our patients and our values is not a deal that we will ever accept. Providing critical health care services for millions of American women is nonnegotiable. This deal seems pretty straightforward, even if the White House never quite made it official. Planned Parenthood wants to keep receiving Title IX funds intended for low-income women who need actual health care that could be provided by other clinics, especially those which offer actual pre-natal health care. If that was the case, they could get rid of the supposed three percent of their business that deals with abortions and use those resources to expand other offerings, including services they already claim to do but don t actually provide at all. Their refusal to even consider the idea speaks volumes about their  values,  as do their abortion sales quotas.Their annual report shows overall revenue at $1.146 billion, which includes $553.7 million from government funds, and only $309.2 million from  non-government health services revenue    fees. If abortions only amount to 3% of their revenue, that would be $34.38 million for 332,000 abortions, or $103 per abortion (gross, not net after costs) if no other revenue was being used to cover it. These numbers don t add up with the 3% claim.Trump s deal makes this much clear, at least: Planned Parenthood values its abortion mill much more than it values $500 million in government funding each year. That really tells us all we need to know about their 3% claim, their values, and the use of taxpayer dollars to subsidize the operations of the world s leading abortion mill.   TownhallBy now, Femi-Nazi s are probably starting to get the idea that they re not dealing with your average spineless politician. Time to pull out the pussy hats and take to the streets ladies. As a conservative woman, I can assure you that the recent women s march (anti-Trump, pro-abortion publicity stunt) was an epic fail. Pro-life female supporters of President Trump are pretty much in agreement that it was the best imaginable way to convince more people to join our team. The vile and disgusting way these women conducted themselves in their fight to keep federal funding alive for the legalized murder of babies, was enough to make undecided women run as far away from them as possible   ",1,en
"Iran fulfilling nuclear deal commitments: IAEA chief. ABU DHABI (Reuters) - Iran is fulfilling its commitments under the nuclear deal with world powers and U.N. inspectors are facing no problems in their verification efforts, the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) director-general said on Monday. U.S. President Donald Trump said earlier this month that he would not continue to certify the multinational 2015 agreement, reached under his predecessor Barack Obama, and warned that he might ultimately terminate it. Iran would abandon the agreement if it were deemed not be serving its national interests, President Hassan Rouhani said in reaction to Trump s decision. But he also said,  No president can revoke an international deal...(and) Iran will continue to honour its commitments under the deal.  The other parties to the accord - Britain, Germany, France, Russia, China and the European Union have all reaffirmed their commitment to it and urged the United States not to back out. IAEA chief Yukiya Amano, whose inspectors are tasked with monitoring compliance with the deal, reiterated that Iran was adhering to it.   The IAEA can state that such nuclear-related commitments are being implemented,  Amano told a news conference in Abu Dhabi following a trip to Iran on Sunday where he met with Rouhani and other officials.  I requested that Iran ... fully implement the nuclear-related commitments. This (was) the main thrust of the meeting in Iran ... Regarding the activities of our inspectors, they are discharging their responsibility without problem,  he said. Under the agreement, Iran undertook to restrict its nuclear programme to help ensure it could not be put to developing atomic bombs in exchange for the lifting of trade and financial sanctions that had hobbled its oil-based economy. Amano added that he had told Iranian officials the nuclear deal was a  significant gain for verification . Speaking on the sidelines of an international conference on nuclear power in the United Arab Emirates, Amano declined comment on U.S. policy towards Iran and on Iran s absence from the meeting, which draws together IAEA member states.

" Tired Of Things Going Well, Marco Rubio Makes Promise To Destroy America Again (VIDEO). Listening to several of the Republican candidates for president, one could wonder if they ve been in a cryogenic sleep for the past seven years, and they re still talking about how badly George W. Bush screwed things up. However, no, they keep repeating the lie that the nation is so much worse now than it was at the brink of a recession before President Obama took over. Republican voters should honestly be insulted by this, being treated like idiots absent from reality. Although, maybe they are idiots absent to reality, and these Republican candidates are just being opportunistic.Repeating this lie of  seven disastrous years  of Obama, Marco Rubio took to the media branch of the GOP, Fox News, to give a quick campaign message and offer his well wishes for the new year. Hi, this is Marco Rubio, a senator from Florida, and a candidate for President of the United States. As we leave 2015 behind and look forward to 2016, with the elections that are coming up in November, this is the year where we re going to have a chance to turn America around. After seven disastrous years of the current president, we have a chance to reclaim the American dream, and that s why I m running for president. And my resolution for 2016 is to do everything I can to not just restore the American dream, but to expand it to reach more people and change more lives than ever before. So that this, the greatest country in the world, can be greater than it s ever been. So, what America does Rubio want to go back to, exactly? One where people are losing their homes? One where jobs are lost at a rate of 750,000 per month? One where people could be denied healthcare for a preexisting condition? One where the 14th amendment is ignored and marriage equality doesn t exist? One where Osama bin Laden is still alive? One where credit card companies can still screw customers over left and right?Honestly, what does Rubio want to do to  turn America around,  because it sure as hell looks as though we are headed in the right direction, and if anything could stand a candidate to continue Obama s progress and advance it further.Rubio apparently wants an America where Wall Street runs the show, people die or go bankrupt from lack of health coverage, and Americans aren t treated equally under the law. So, if that s the America Rubio wants   thanks, but no thanks. .@marcorubio:  This is the year where we re going to have a chance to turn America around.  #FoxNews2016 https://t.co/yvze0WpCKg  Fox News (@FoxNews) January 1, 2016 Video/Featured image: Twitter",1,en

"Ryan says U.S. Congress will press for new sanctions against Iran. WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. House of Representatives Speaker Paul Ryan said on Tuesday that lawmakers would continue to press for new sanctions against Tehran “until the regime ends its violent, provocative behavior against the U.S. and our allies.” Ryan, whose Republican party opposed the landmark nuclear agreement the Obama administration and five other world powers reached with Tehran last year, said Iran’s latest reported missile test violated international law. Iran’s Islamic Revolutionary Guards Corps (IRGC) test-fired several ballistic missiles on Tuesday, state television said, challenging a United Nations resolution and drawing the threat of a diplomatic response from the United States. U.S. and French officials had earlier said a missile test by Iran would violate U.N. Security Council Resolution 2231, which calls on Iran not to conduct “any activity” related to ballistic missiles capable of delivering nuclear weapons. Several Republican lawmakers called for more U.S. sanctions in response, but there were no immediate plans to introduce new legislation. The House last month passed a measure that would have limited President Barack Obama’s ability to lift sanctions under the nuclear pact, but there are no plans for the Senate to take up the legislation, which Obama is expected to veto. Senator Bob Corker, the Republican chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, said his staff was working on an alternative that could win enough support to pass the Senate, but which would require Democratic support. “We’re having discussions right now and trying to see what type of legislation is passable,” he told Reuters.

"Facebook's Zuckerberg to meet conservatives on political bias flap. (Reuters) - Facebook Chief Executive Mark Zuckerberg will meet this week with prominent conservatives in the media, a spokesman said on Sunday, to address allegations of political bias at the popular social networking site. Some 12 “conservative thought leaders” will join the meeting with Zuckerberg on Wednesday, a Facebook spokesman said. Among the invitees are media personality Glenn Beck, Fox News Channel’s “The Five” co-host Dana Perino and Zac Moffatt, co-founder of Targeted Victory, a technology company that aims to bring transparency to media buying. Facebook came under fire last week when an unnamed former employee told technology news website Gizmodo that workers often omitted conservative political stories from the company’s “trending” list of topics. Zuckerberg said Facebook has “found no evidence that this report is true,” but would continue to investigate. A U.S. Senate committee has also opened an inquiry into Facebook’s practices. Beck, a former Fox News host, took to Facebook early Sunday to say he is going to the meeting in Menlo Park, California, and  “it would be interesting to look him (Zuckerberg) in the eye as he explains.” “While they are a private business and I support their right to run it any way they desire without government interference,” Beck said, “it would be wonderful if a tool like face book [sic] INDEPENDENTLY CHOSE to hold up Freedom of speech and freedom of association as a corporate principle.” On Friday, Facebook outlined its “Trending Topics” guidelines in its media relations section and stated that reviewers are neither allowed nor advised to discriminate against sources.  Facebook, now valued at around $350 billion, has become a bigger source of news for its more than 1 billion daily active users. Sixty-three percent of users, or 41 percent of all U.S. adults, say they get news from the site, according to a study last year by the Pew Research Center and the Knight Foundation.  ",0,en

"You Wouldn’t Allow Someone To Abuse Your Child…So Why Do We Allow Climate Change Radicals To Target Them?.  So, if the climate scare-mongers can t frighten the adults, the next logical step is to heap angst on their children who then frighten (or better, pester) the adults into action. You need to read this ENTIRE story and watch the video near the end of the page. Finally, the United Nations Environmental Programme is spending our money to come out with scary children s fairy tales about global warming. Sedena, the Mother of the Sea, is featured in the UN Environmental Programme s latest children s book on global warming entitled  Tore and the Town on Thin Ice . This book tells the story of a young boy named Tore who lives in a village in the Arctic and is upset when he loses a dog sled race. The Mother of the Sea appears in Tore s dream and informs him that the thinning ice, which caused his loss in the dog sled race, was due to man-made global warming. But that is nothing compared to what it is doing to the Mother of the Sea s own dominion and to all living creatures. She sends an owl, a polar bear, and a whale to scare poor Tore into thinking that they will become extinct during his lifetime and that  our world is melting  from climate changes, mostly caused by those bad people in  rich countries  who are spewing gases in the air from their  huge cars , air conditioners and the like. In the words of the whale, children like Tore should  get good and angry . The book ends with a so-called  facts  section, blaming climate change on the  Industrial Revolution in Europe and North America  and singling out the United States in particular for its contribution to the production of  carbon dioxide added by humans.  It claims that  climate change will hit the poorer countries hardest  while at the same time saying that New York along with other coastal areas  could disappear beneath the waves. A psychotherapist, a true believer in the Climate Church, nevertheless argues that children should not be targeted by the climate activists   it is not good for the children and it is not good for the cause. I wish she could also see that her cause is a phony one, but I m glad she is against harming children in the name of it:Climate change community groups often want to work with children.  We must get into the schools,  says someone and there is a nod of agreement. It s worth thinking about the psychology behind this. Why is this idea so appealing? And why is it so damaging?The appeal is clear. It s fun working with children: they re responsive, creative and willing. And it s certainly easier than working with white-van-man, frequent fliers or the oil industry. The reasons given for working with children are usually two-fold:We need to influence them while they are young. If they understand the issue and the effect of their actions, they will grow up finding it natural to care for the environment. It s a good way of getting to their parents. Who can resist their child pleading with them to change the lightbulbs because it will save a polar bear?Both reasons are suspect. The first reason assumes that instruction   at best participatory, at worst didactic   is the route either to action or to the inculcation of positive values towards the environment. There is little evidence for this. We know that information based campaigns have a limited impact with adults, so why should we expect children to be different? As for values   these tend to be formed through experience, relationship, identification and social systems, not through information. If the school has an influence on values it will be through its culture, ethos and the relationships and experiences it offers not through the information it provides.Both reasons also raise direct ethical questions. It is easy to engage the sympathies of children with stories of damage to the natural world and images of suffering animals they will identify with. But children have very little power. Of all the sections of society who might make an impact on climate change, they have the least influence, the least agency, the least leverage. There is a real risk of raising levels of anxiety amongst children that will not only cause distress in the immediate term but will in the long term lead to those children turning against the environmental causes we hoped they might espouse.When I was 10 a speaker came to my school and told us about food shortages and starvation in the third world. I rushed home and explained to my parents that we needed to grow more food. I couldn t understand why they wouldn t accede to my idea of banding together with the neighbours and turning all our back gardens into a corn field. I was left haunted by images of dying children, guilt at my good fortune and the anxiety that feeds on powerlessness. In adolescence I became determinedly indifferent to the appeals from 3rd world charities. As an adult I have continued to find them difficult to relate to.We need to ask   what happens to the child whose parents are indifferent to their attempts to get them to act? What happens to the child who is overwhelmed by stories of disasters he or she cannot influence?But the deeper question is   why are adults so keen to focus on children? Why concentrate on the weakest, least influential members of society and ask them to act?Got kids? Watched as they ve been indoctrinated   sorry, I mean educated   about global warming over the last decade? Then you ll know what I mean. They come home from school moodily depressed about the future of our planet and, of course, what that means for their own lives. What s the point? We re all doomed! Why study? Why bother getting an education? It s futile. Sea levels are rising. Temperatures are soaring. Soon we ll all be living in a polluted hell-hole constantly battling the equivalent of the Queensland floods or the Victorian bushfires year upon year. And you want me to waste what precious time I have left studying accountancy? It s called nihilism, and it s even more terrifying to witness in your teenage children than hickeys, drunkenness, truancy, insolence, idleness, bad marks or bullying. Nihilism, or the conviction that life on Earth is totally pointless, saps the young of their energy, their ambition, and their will to strive, struggle and triumph.  Extract from an online article by Rowan Dean, 17 August 2011.A postgraduate student in Oxford gets it  This should be a wake-up call for all the purveyors of the  politics of fear . Children are, naturally, relatively powerless and likely to feel overwhelmed by the challenges facing mankind. But as adults, we should have a greater sense of our own collective power to master problems and build better societies. Not only does jumping from one panic to another, each with disastrous consequences   mobile phone radiation, BSE, SARS, crime, paedophilia, terrorism, bird flu, global warming   diminish our own sense of agency, by turning childhood dreams of utopia into nightmarish visions of the future it is teaching the citizens of the future all the wrong lessons. This is one of the best videos we have seen on  climate change.  There are 5 parts to this series. This is Part 1:An excellent, easy to understand piece about the TRUTH surrounding phony climate cooling, warming, change:The pollution resulting from the rapid uncontrolled post-war industrial expansion spawned two environmentalist movements. One group primarily composed of physical scientists and engineers set about to directly address the pollution problems by developing facilities and legislative controls that have to date virtually eliminated industrial contamination of soil, water and air.A second group primarily composed of activists with little or no physical science background did nothing but protest against industry without ever having addressed a single environmental problem for which they created a solution.While the physical scientists and engineers worked quietly with industry solving the environmental problems, the ideology driven environmentalist activists, used dramatic alarmist rhetoric to gain media control and have become a dominant political force capable of forcing their self-serving ideologies on the general public with impunity.The Earth entered a cooling phase in 1942, and by 1970 the environmentalists found a way to blame this cooling on industrial expansion. The concept was that particulate matter from fossil fuel usage was blocking energy from the sun giving this cooling effect. This concept was incorporated as a parameter in the crude climate models of the time, and the predictions from models run by James Hansen in 1971 projected fifty years of further cooling from the increased use of fossil fuels.Only four years later, and in spite of the continued increase in fossil fuel usage global cooling came to an end, proving that the models did not have a proper physical basis for relating fossil fuel usage to global cooling.By 1988, after 13 years of global warming the ideological environmentalists developed a new tact for blaming fossil fuels. The British Government had embarked on a political campaign to promote their nuclear industry and attack the powerful coal unions by creating alarmist scenarios of  runaway global warming  resulting from CO2 produced by coal and other fossil fuels. This was entirely political in nature with absolutely no scientific backing, but it did make the perfect weapon for the environmentalists to promote their anti energy (and anti humanity) ideology. All that was needed was some scientific justification.As was done in 1971, climate models which were now far more sophisticated provided the science backing. Instead of blaming fossil fuels for blocking incoming solar radiation, the models removed this parameter and replaced it with a newly contrived parameter that now related global warming to the effect of fossil fuel sourced CO2 on the outgoing thermal radiation from the Earth.This model also produced by James Hansen, projected warming for the next century because of the fossil fuel CO2 emissions that were increasing at a continued accelerated rate. As with the 1971 model, the 1988 model was proven to be false when global warming ended after 1998 even as CO2 emissions continued to rise at unprecedented rates. To make matters worse since 2002, the Earth has been cooling making all of the projections clearly in the wrong direction.By even the most basic standards of ethical science, models that first predict cooling from fossil fuel usage that are discredited just four years later when warming occurs with increased usage, and then predict warming from fossil fuel usage and are again discredited ten years later as cooling reoccurs with increased usage, would be declared absolutely invalid; but when ideology is involved science protocol is totally abandoned.Impact 2009As a result of the alarmist predictions of the 1988 climate models of Hansen, the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) was formed under the auspices of the United Nations. This body was given a science mandate to investigate the possibility of human effects on climate to determine if the projections of Hansen were valid.The true nature of the IPCC was not that of a science based body, but that of a political body to give scientific legitimacy to false alarmist predictions in order to meet a political self serving environmentalist agenda. Since its inception, the IPCC has used its position of authority to promote its agenda to the detriment of science and even more importantly to the detriment of the global population.From 1997 to 1998 the average global temperature increased by over half a degree C and from 1998 to 1999 the average global temperature fell by over half a degree C. This was due to an extraordinary el Ni o and has nothing to do with either the greenhouse effect or CO2 emissions (CO2 emissions increased from 24.0gt/y in 1997 to 24.2gt/y in 1998 to 24.4gt/y in 1999).An honest scientific body would have made some sort of statement to this effect, but the IPCC in their 2001 Third Assessment Report and particularly in their Summary for Policy Makers for this report not only made no mention of the fact that from 1998 to 1999 the Earth cooled more than it had ever cooled during the entire global temperature record, but emphatically stated that from 1997 to 1998 the Earth had warmed more than it ever had.This is an absolute violation of science ethics because the policy makers were purposely misinformed with alarmist rhetoric. This same 2001 report also stated that the observed global warming for the past century which they stated was attributable to CO2 emissions was measured at 0.60 C + 0.20 C. This is only 0.006 C per year making the el Ni o temperature spike over eighty times greater than what the IPCC stated was attributable to CO2 emissions, so it is clear that this was stated for the purpose of politically motivated alarmism and not to properly convey information in a scientifically justified manner.The 2001 IPCC report also included the infamous MBH98  Hockey Stick  temperature proxy which used physical temperature measurement data up to and including 1998 which gave the alarmist impression of twice the 20th century warming because 1999 was not included.The Hockey Stick graph became the pivotal evidence that convinced governments around the world to ratify the Kyoto Protocol, that has resulted in such detrimental effects to the global population and global economy.In this regard the el Ni o temperature spike of 1998 may be considered the most significant climate event in recent history, and when one considers the hundreds of millions of the world s poorest people starving because of Kyoto biofuel initiatives that has literally taken their food away and made it into  Kyoto friendly  fuel, this el Ni o might also be considered the most tragic climate event as well.Through diligence and hard work physical scientists were able to correct most of the environmental problems that had been created through industrialization, but there is no scientific effort capable of undoing the damage caused to the global population by the ideological environmentalists. This issue is now out of the hands of the scientists and the only salvation for the global population is the media who must readopt their lost journalistic integrity and expose the true nature of this global fraud.",1,en

"Draft U.N. blacklist names Saudi coalition for killing children in Yemen. UNITED NATIONS (Reuters) - A confidential draft United Nations blacklist seen by Reuters on Tuesday names a Saudi Arabia-led military coalition for killing and maiming children in Yemen, though it notes that the alliance has put in place measures to improve child protection. In an effort to dampen controversy surrounding the annual children and armed conflict report, the draft blacklist - contained in an annex to the full report - is split into  listed parties that have put in place measures during the reporting period to improve the protection of children  and those which have not.   In Yemen, the coalition s actions objectively led to the listing for the killing and maiming of children, with 683 child casualties attributed to this party, and, as a result of being responsible for 38 verified incidents, for attacks on schools and hospitals during 2016,  according to a draft explanation of the blacklist seen by Reuters.   The coalition is included in section B of Annex I, as it has put in place measures during the reporting period aimed at improving the protection of children,  the draft said. The draft U.N. annex blacklists the Houthis, Yemen government forces, pro-government militia and Al Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula for violations against children in 2016 as it did in last year s report covering violations in 2015.   The draft report has to be approved by U.N. Secretary-General Antonio Guterres and is subject to change. It is due to be submitted to the U.N. Security Council this month, and the 15-member body is to discuss the report on Oct. 31.  The Saudi U.N. ambassador, Abdallah Al-Mouallimi, declined to comment until the report is officially issued. In August, the Saudi U.N. mission said there was  no justification whatsoever  for including the coalition on the blacklist.  U.N. spokesman Stephane Dujarric said the United Nations does not comment on leaked documents.  The coalition was briefly added to the blacklist last year and then removed by then-U.N. chief Ban Ki-moon pending review. At the time, Ban accused Saudi Arabia of exerting  unacceptable  undue pressure after sources told Reuters that Riyadh threatened to cut its U.N. funding. Saudi Arabia denied threatening Ban. The report - produced by U.N. children and armed conflict envoy Virginia Gamba and issued in Guterres  name - does not subject those listed to any U.N. action, but rather shames parties to conflicts in the hope of pushing them to implement measures to protect children. The Saudi-led coalition began a military campaign in Yemen in March 2015 with the aim of preventing Iran-allied Houthi rebels and forces loyal to Yemen s ex-President Ali Abdullah Saleh from taking power. An earlier draft of the latest annual report, which covers 2016 and was seen by Reuters in August, said that of the 683 child casualties blamed on the Saudi-led coalition, about half of those were killed and the rest injured.   That earlier draft said the Houthi rebels and affiliated forces were responsible for nearly a third of the total 1,340 child casualties verified by the United Nations.  The annual children and armed conflict report is produced at the request of the U.N. Security Council. In 2015 the United Nations left Israel and the Palestinian militant group Hamas off the blacklist, after they had been included in an earlier draft, but criticized Israel over its 2014 military operations. Separately, the Geneva-based U.N. Human Rights Council agreed on Friday to set up a panel to examine all alleged human rights violations committed in Yemen s war and identify those responsible. U.N. human rights chief Zeid Ra ad al-Hussein had long-pleaded with the 47-member Human Rights Council to launch an independent investigation into the war, which has killed thousands, ruined the economy and pushed millions to the brink of famine.

"Lebanon's Hariri shackled by bigger outside forces.  BEIRUT (Reuters) - Nothing so encapsulated the political shackles in which Saad al-Hariri has operated as Lebanon s prime minister as the way he resigned in a televised statement made from Saudi Arabia.  Every major decision by the unlikely politician was determined by factors beyond his control. He entered politics after the 2005 assassination of his father and his resignation served the agenda of Riyadh.  The dependence of their leaders on powerful external patrons is nothing new in Lebanon, where regional powers from Saudi Arabia to Iran have long tussled for geopolitical advantage.  But the case of Hariri, who many Lebanese think was summoned to the Saudi capital, coerced into resigning and put under house arrest - which he has denied - underscores an instance of external pressure extreme even by Lebanon s high standards.  In an interview on Sunday, he said he will return to Lebanon in the coming days and might reconsider his resignation. Even if he does, the events of the past 10 days show how decisions taken beyond Lebanon's borders would still define his role.  His shock resignation statement on Nov. 4, which has thrust Lebanon into a new political crisis, included a laundry list of Saudi complaints about the behavior of Iran and its Lebanese ally Hezbollah, Riyadh s main political adversaries.  Iran and Hezbollah, Hariri said, are  sowing strife  in the Arab world.  As Riyadh s ally at a time of its enemies  ascendancy, Hariri was already playing Lebanon s intricate political game from a position of weakness.  A year ago, after spending years abroad, he agreed to join a national unity government with President Michel Aoun, a former rival and Hezbollah ally, that included Hezbollah itself.  It was a compromise he said was necessary to end Lebanon s sectarian-tinged political paralysis and one that was personally difficult, as Hariri accuses Hezbollah of the assassination of his father, Rafik al-Hariri.  He seemed committed to that compromise until the moment he flew to Riyadh on Nov. 3, telling officials of discussions planned for his return the following Monday.  Saudi Arabia had previously accepted Hariri s political bargain in Lebanon. But Iran s trumpeting of its successes along with Hezbollah in the wars in Syria and Yemen at the expense of Saudi allies may have altered Riyadh s calculation.  A day after traveling to Riyadh, Hariri appeared on television reading a statement of resignation.  Hariri s career was built on the backing of Gulf states, the deployment of his family fortune - spending large amounts of it in Lebanon to finance a media network and charitable gifts to secure widespread support - and feelings of respect among many Lebanese for his late father.  In his resignation address, Saad said:  We are living in a climate similar to the atmosphere that prevailed before the assassination of Rafik al-Hariri .  In Lebanon s sectarian system, the prime minister must always be a Sunni Muslim and Rafik made his family pre-eminent among Lebanese Sunnis.  Rafik carved out a business empire in Saudi Arabia with the backing of its ruling family and returned to Lebanon to rebuild when the civil war there ended in 1990, serving twice as prime minister. The car bomb that killed Rafik gave Saad little choice but to adopt a previously unsought role as political leader.  Before being plunged into Lebanon s volatile politics, Saad had led a playboy lifestyle running his father s business. He was raised in Saudi Arabia and has Saudi nationality.  Outrage at Rafik s killing helped Hariri s movement to electoral victory five months later and he installed a political ally as prime minister, not taking the post himself until 2009.  It was the first government headed by factions opposed to the influence of Syria - and by extension Damascus  allies Iran and Hezbollah - since the 1975-90 Lebanese civil war.  That opposition came to a head in 2008 when the government tried to seize Hezbollah s telecommunications network, triggering street battles in Beirut that the heavily armed Shi ite Muslim movement won.  Qatar brokered a compromise, with Hariri becoming head of a coalition government that included Hezbollah. But Hezbollah pulled out in 2011, bringing down the administration.  As tensions rose over the war in neighboring Syria, Hariri left Lebanon, spending most of the ensuing years abroad until he returned months before joining a new government last year.  But his sway - and that of his family s regional patron Saudi Arabia - had diminished. The formation of last year s government was widely seen in Lebanon as an acknowledgement of the political dominance of Iran and Hezbollah.  Saudi Arabia s own apparent impatience with Hariri became evident in the fortunes of the family company - Saudi Oger - whose billions had underpinned their political role in Lebanon.  With a new dispensation in Riyadh under King Salman and his ambitious son Prince Mohammed, and a fall in oil prices damaging its finances, the Saudi government seemed less willing to roll out big state projects to enrich some allies.  When Hariri s first stint as premier ended in 2011, he said in a newspaper interview:  In Lebanon it s never over for anyone .  A source in his camp said a compromise to bring him back to Beirut as prime minister was still possible if Aoun distanced himself from Hezbollah s regional role.  Such a statement by Aoun might give some satisfaction to Saudi Arabia, but it would seem to leave Hariri no stronger than before.  After so public a departure, especially one delivered from abroad, his dependence on Riyadh has been made especially visible. His enemies in Lebanon even mocked his Arabic during his resignation speech as being more Saudi than Lebanese.  And the posters of him that have appeared across Beirut with the slogan  We are with you  looked less like statements of mass support than solidarity with a political hostage.  ",0,en
"RIDICULOUS! NBC STIRS UP FEAR Of A Trump Presidency With Zero Credible Reasons…They Think We’re Stupid. During the first half of their extended post-election coverage Wednesday evening, NBC Nightly News seemed to be setting the ground work for four years of a President Donald Trump all while stoking the left s anxieties.  There were gasps around the world. Headlines,  Trumpocalypse  and  Disunited States  hyped NBC s Chief Foreign Correspondent Richard Engel as he delved into the ridiculous,  But there are deeper concerns tonight that the world s shining light of democracy has gone dark. You cannot look at President Trump and call the American president the leader of the free world  fretted the leftist Eurasia Group President Ian Bremmer to Engel,  Because America has increasingly abdicated its legitimacy to that title. Engel claimed that the only world leaders to welcome a President Trump was a vast array of some of the world worst despots,  Those welcoming the most were right-wing parties, who rushed to embrace Trump as their new hero.  Engels was eager to tie as many of them to Trump as possible: He s like me,  joked the Filipino president, accused of turning his police into anti-narco death squads. Egypt s General Sisi, who came to power in a coup bragged he was the first foreign leader to congratulate Trump. And Hungary s Victor Orban who did wall out his country to keep out refugees called Trump  great news.  And of course, Russia s Vladimir Putin. ",1,en

" It Looks Like The Trump Campaign Just Got This Reporter Arrested. While Donald Trump accuses Hillary Clinton of being crooked and freedom hating, a member of the press was arrested at a his Houston rally after simply inquiring about press credentials.Alex Thompson of Vice News was arrested at the Omni Westside hotel for  trespassing.  Thompson, inquiring as to whether or not his pending press credentials had been approved or denied, entered the hotel lobby to ask members of Trump s communications staff what the final say was.According to Vice News:A man who identified himself as a hotel manager then asked Thompson to leave and warned that he would be arrested if he did not. Roughly two minutes later, without further warning and while Thompson was waiting for a member of Trump s staff to clarify his access to the event, he was arrested by Houston Police, handcuffed, and escorted outside. Thompson spoke with his editors while handcuffed and said that he was never given any opportunity to explain himself to police.And just like that, a reporter was arrested for requesting an answer to his ability to report on the rally, which is his constitutional right.Ryan McCarthy, editor-in-chief of Vice, tweeted:Our reporter @AlxThomp was arrested today outside a Trump event   for doing his job https://t.co/kS2PG5Igyc  Ryan McCarthy (@mccarthyryanj) September 17, 2016Of course the Trump campaign denied any knowing or involvement of the incident, saying,  The campaign was not involved in this incident or aware of the details surrounding it. The event organizers were responsible for today s media presence and requested the campaign limit attendance to the traveling pool. Thompson was released on bond overnight, and the Houston police claimed that he issued an ultimatum: arrest him or leave him alone, because he is not leaving until he gets an answer, as he   a member of the press   is entitled to.Vice has hinted that their lawyers are working on getting the charges dropped.Given Trump and his campaign s hostility to the media (which includes threatening to sue the New York Times, tightening libel laws, and calling CNN panelists a bunch of losers), could having a reporter arrested seem too far out there? The answer is no.Whether or not Trump or anyone in his campaign made the call is not know. But we do know this much: the campaign had his credentials pending; he inquired but to no avail; he inquired again, and was arrested for  trespassing,  even though the event was public.Trump is no friend of the press, or the freedom of the press to report on the asinine and ridiculous things he and his supporters cough up. That should scare everyone.Featured image via Joe Readle/Getty Images",1,en

"DEPLORABLE! CROOKED CLINTON’S Ask For Donations To Help Haiti Following Hurricane Matthew…After Using 2010 Earthquake Donations To Rob Them Blind [VIDEO]. Despite the media s best attempts to keep the truth hidden from the public, poor Haitian activists and a few honest journalists have managed to expose the truth about how the Clinton s and their  foundation  raped the poor island of Haiti. The Clinton s took billions from people around the world who trusted them to help the poorest of the poor, following a devastating hurricane in 2010. Here is what Haitians have to say about the  help  they got from the Clinton Foundation:Thanks to the media, who has largely hidden this story, Bill Clinton is able to once again make a shameless pitch the world, asking them to donate to the Clinton Foundation, so they can help the Haitians. There has never been a more shameless and selfish couple in public office in America. Here s Bill s pitch:In the wake of the devastating destruction to Haiti caused by Hurricane Matthew, President Bill Clinton took to Twitter and urged his six million-plus followers to go to the embattled Clinton Foundation to assist in relief efforts.Praying for everyone impacted by #HurricaneMatthew. Here's how you can help in Haiti: https://t.co/OX77AS2bT6  Bill Clinton (@billclinton) October 4, 2016 Praying for everyone impacted by #HurricaneMatthew. Here s how you can help in Haiti,  Clinton said his tweet, which linked to a Medium article, entitled,  Members of the Clinton Foundation Community Respond to Hurricane Matthew; Ways to Support. The last time tragedy struct the tiny Caribbean country, Bill and then-Secretary of State Hillary Clinton   according to scores of enraged Haitians   used their billion dollar charity and leveraged their global connections to enrich themselves and their monied cronies.Following the devastating earthquake in Haiti in 2010   while 316,000 lifeless bodies lay buried under rubble, and while 300,000 Haitians suffered from injuries, with another 1.3 million displaced   the Clintons saw an opportunity to cash in.Watch here to see how the Clinton Foundation ripped off Haiti:https://youtu.be/nlS4SimQfv8Hillary Clinton s brother, Tony Rodham, landed a lucrative and historically rare Haitian  gold exploitation permit,  while Clinton Foundation donors, including Digicel mobile phone company founder Denis O Brien, were winning multi-million dollar contracts that would siphon massive profits from the poorest country in the Western Hemisphere.While then-Secretary of State Hillary Clinton s State Department was funneling billions in relief funds to rebuild Haiti, the Clinton Foundation was leveraging its influence to guide high-dollar contracts to longtime Clinton cronies who would go on to reap millions off the catastrophe that had claimed so many lives on the devastated island. I deal through the Clinton Foundation,  Tony Rodham said according to a transcript of his testimony during court proceedings, obtained by The New York Times.  That gets me in touch with the Haitian officials. I hound my brother-in-law [Bill Clinton], because it s his fund that we re going to get our money from. And he can t do it until the Haitian government does it. The anger at the Clintons from the Haitian people is no secret.Indeed, dozens of Haitian protesters gathered outside the Democrat National Convention in July and railed against the Clintons and the Clinton Foundation for their long-reported history of using their global connections to exploit the resources and the poor people of Haiti. The main message is that Hillary Clinton belongs in jail,  one protester said at the time when asked what the overall message of the protest was.  We believe that the world should know about the crimes the Clinton family has committed against the country of Haiti the money they have stolen from the earthquake victims. And we believe that were this to be anyone else, they d be in jail right now. She s not in jail because she s being protected by the Obama administration, the Justice Department, State Department,  the protester said. Via: Breitbart ",1,en

"U.N. torture envoy concerned at water-boarding rhetoric in U.S. race. GENEVA (Reuters) - The U.N. torture investigator voiced concern on Wednesday at calls by some Republican candidates in the U.S. presidential race to authorize water-boarding in interrogating detainees, noting that it was illegal under domestic and international law. Republican candidate Donald Trump softened his stance on torture last Friday, saying he would not order the U.S. military to break international laws on how to treat terrorism suspects. The night before, he indicated he might order U.S. military to break the law on interrogation tactics, including waterboarding. Trump’s rival and number two in the Republican primaries, Senator Ted Cruz of Texas, said last month he would only allow limited use of the practice. He said he didn’t believe waterboarding met the international definition for torture. “Candidates in the United States have again discussed whether waterboarding is torture or not and have actually promised to bring it back and to bring even harsher techniques,” Juan Mendez, U.N. special rappporteur on torture, told a news briefing in Geneva. The Bush administration allowed the use of waterboarding - the practice of pouring water over a cloth covering a detainee’s face to mimic the sensation of drowning - around conflicts in Iraq and Afghanistan. President Barack Obama banned it days after taking office in 2009. “The Bush administration itself had withdrawn the torture memos when it was discovered that these things were happening as a matter of policy,” Mendez said. “Even the Republican administration had already recognized that these things are illegal.” “They are illegal as a matter of international law, they are illegal as a matter of constitutional law in the United States, they are illegal as a matter of military law...and they are immoral anyway,” he said. Speaking as a U.S. citizen, rather than in his U.N. role, he said: “Yes, I think the damage in the standing of the United States as a law-abiding nation and as an example to other states to fight crime and terrorism within the strictures of the rule of law is very seriously damaged by this kind of rhetoric.” The Senate Intelligence Committee released a report in 2014, despite the objection of Republicans, that detailed what it called torture tactics used by the Central Intelligence Agency, including extensive use of waterboarding.

" This One Factor Determines If You’re A Trump Supporter, And It’s Not What You Think. Trump supporters have a lot in common. They lack education. They re a bunch of horrible racists. They want to  make America great again  by viciously beating African-American protesters and homeless people. The idea of keeping brown people out of  Murika appeals to them. His appeal to racists is so great that white supremacists are actively campaigning for him and terrorist groups are using his hate speech to recruit. But did you know that one factor you haven t thought of defines Trump support better than jingoism, racism, homophobia, extreme anti-Muslim sentiments, or a desire to build a gigantic wall so we never have to even look at a Hispanic person again?Politico s Matthew MacWilliams says he has discovered one factor that predicts whether or not someone is a Trump voter:In fact, I ve found a single statistically significant variable predicts whether a voter supports Trump and it s not race, income or education levels: It s authoritarianism.That s right, Trump s electoral strength and his staying power have been buoyed, above all, by Americans with authoritarian inclinations. And because of the prevalence of authoritarians in the American electorate, among Democrats as well as Republicans, it s very possible that Trump s fan base will continue to grow.MacWilliams just finished conducting a national poll which sampled 1,800 voters across the nation.  I found that education, income, gender, age, ideology and religiosity had no significant bearing on a Republican voter s preferred candidate,  he writes.  Only two of the variables I looked at were statistically significant: authoritarianism, followed by fear of terrorism, though the former was far more significant than the latter. MacWilliams explains that Trump s pledge to make  America great again  as well as his horrific suggestions that Muslims be banned from the United States, wear special ID badges if they re already here, and be rounded up into concentration camps (as well, of course, as his Great Wall of Murika), all cater to authoritarian inclinations:Authoritarianism is not a new, untested concept in the American electorate. Since the rise of Nazi Germany, it has been one of the most widely studied ideas in social science. While its causes are still debated, the political behavior of authoritarians is not. Authoritarians obey. They rally to and follow strong leaders. And they respond aggressively to outsiders, especially when they feel threatened.This, of course, describes Trump supporters perfectly. Frighteningly, authoritarianism (while prevalent among Republicans) is not limited to the Right. In the 2008 Democratic primary, the political scientist Marc Hetherington found that authoritarianism mattered more than income, ideology, gender, age and education in predicting whether voters preferred Hillary Clinton over Barack Obama,  MacWilliams notes.  But Hetherington has also found, based on 14 years of polling, that authoritarians have steadily moved from the Democratic to the Republican Party over time  since they began to embrace civil rights, gay rights, and other hallmarks of liberalism that are common in the party today.MacWilliams notes that authoritarianism is not  a statistically significant factor in the Democratic primary race  thus far, but  it does appear to be playing an important role on the Republican side,  as 49 percent of Republicans score  in the top quarter of the authoritarian scale. MacWilliams  poll asked voters some simple questions about parenting to gauge authoritarianism:  whether it is more important for the voter to have a child who is respectful or independent; obedient or self-reliant; well-behaved or considerate; and well-mannered or curious. Based on these questions, Trump was the only candidate Republican or Democrat whose support among authoritarians was statistically significant,  he concludes. This, combined with the 52% of respondents who live in fear of a terrorist attack on U.S. soil, gives us something to fear. While it s easy to say President Trump  can t happen here    that Americans won t stand for the ideological reincarnation of Adolf Hitler being elected   MacWilliams points out that it s time that Democrats and all who oppose fascism begin taking Trump seriously.Featured image via Gage Skidmore/Flickr",1,en

"Merkel call to stop Turkey's EU bid draws mixed response. TALLINN/PARIS (Reuters) - German Chancellor Angela Merkel s call to stop Turkey s European Union accession talks drew a mixed response from the bloc s foreign ministers on Thursday, while French President Emmanuel Macron said Ankara remained a vital partner of the EU. NATO allies Germany and Turkey have traded increasingly bitter words over the last two years, contributing to an overall souring of Ankara s relations with the EU. President Tayyip Erdogan s crackdown on dissent following a failed 2016 coup attempt has drawn broad condemnation in the bloc. Merkel announced her toughened stance on Turkey s long-stalled EU bid in a TV debate last Sunday as she faced off with her main rival in national elections due on Sept. 24. Her Foreign Minister Sigmar Gabriel, arriving for talks with his EU colleagues in the Estonian capital Tallinn, said it was Turkey itself that was moving away from the EU. Austria s Sebastian Kurz reiterated his line that the talks should end.  But Finland and Lithuania spoke out against breaking off the talks, which opened formally in 2005 but stalled over Erdogan s track record on human rights and the unresolved issue of Cyprus - a Mediterranean island that belongs to the EU but of which part falls under an unrecognized protectorate of Turkey.  No, we should continue the process and engagement. It s not easy but we have to value contacts,  Lithuania s Linas Linkevicius told reporters.  By stopping, by cutting, we will ...encourage them even more to go away. I think the effect would be the opposite than what we d wish.  EU entry talks, no matter how protracted, had long been seen in themselves as a stimulus to Turkish democratic reform; but EU officials see a slide back in recent years with judicial independence and freedom of speech in peril. Turkey s EU ties minister, Omer Celik, is due to join the bloc s 28 officials for talks in Tallinn later on Thursday. The EU is wary of upsetting Erdogan, eager to preserve a deal that stemmed the mass migration via Turkey of people from conflict zones in the tumultuous Middle East.   We have to tread very carefully and, while discussing Turkey s status as a candidate country, we should also discuss the future relationship in all its aspects,  Estonia s Sven Mikser said in Tallinn. He said he did not expect the EU to make any formal decision this year, adding that the bloc needed to cooperate with Ankara on migration and security in particular. The French president told Greece s Kathimerini newspaper that ties with Turkey should be maintained.  Turkey has indeed strayed away from the European Union in recent months and worryingly overstepped the mark in ways that cannot be ignored,  he said.  But I want to avoid a split because it s a vital partner in many crises we all face, notably the immigration challenge and the terrorist threat.  With other countries in the EU also advocating more  strategic patience , the unanimity of 28 member states required to kill off Turkey s bid seems absent. But suspending accession talks, which the European Parliament has already called for repeatedly, would only require the backing of majority of EU states. Merkel wants to discuss that with fellow EU leaders at their summit planned in October 19-20, more than three weeks after  Germany s election. A senior Turkish official said EU states must decide whether they wanted Turkey as a member, but there was a sense  they no longer want the marriage...(but) want cohabitation . Kati Piri, a European Parliament speaker on Turkey, advised suspending the membership track but pushing ahead with customs union talks as the  most realistic leverage the EU can now have to try negotiate some standards with Turkey .  Turkey under this government does not even uphold the minimum human rights standards now. But we should not take away the EU perspective from the Turkish people, and in suspending talks we would have to name conditions for reviving them.   But this German twist is triggered by German elections, not by some change on the side of Turkey. So what does Merkel really mean? I think it s likely she will return to her usual pragmatism after the elections,  Piri told Reuters. ",0,en

" Sean Hannity Just Openly Threatened Someone On Twitter, And It May Be A Fox News Exec. Is there some reason people like Donald Trump and his most ardent fans can t handle problems without making threats? Sean Hannity is publicly threatening someone after tweeting that he s been talking to lawyers about  libel, slander, defamation, tortious interference.  As an alleged journalist, he really ought to know what those words mean and not throw them around.He s also doing quite a bit of posturing about it, up to and including issuing this threat:Oh FYI, Whoever you are just remember, IP addresses are traceable. Get Ready.  Sean Hannity (@seanhannity) May 1, 2017Many on that tweet assume he s referring to his sexual harassment accuser, Debbie Schlussel. However, this tweet suggests he s talking about whoever it is he thinks  the traitor  is at Fox News:This is way way way bigger than any one individual. https://t.co/ERvdrmUdeE  Sean Hannity (@seanhannity) April 30, 2017Hannity recently gave an interview to Vanity Fair, in which he defended embattled co-president Bill Shine, who has been caught up in the sexual harassment investigation into Fox News. In it, he said there was a traitor at Fox News, and claimed to know who it is. After Bill O Reilly s ouster amid a sexual harassment scandal, people began saying that  they  were going to come after Hannity.Sure enough, Schlussel came forward saying that Hannity had been creepy with her. Hannity has repeatedly denied that he was even remotely inappropriate with her, and he and his followers seem to think that she s either an active participant in some grand conspiracy to shut down Fox News (and indeed, conservatives in general) entirely, or a pawn that  they  are using to take down every conservative there is.Honestly, he sounds too much like Trump, dropping saying on Twitter that he s got all this information and hinting that it could blow something wide open. Since he s a television personality, it s a little more likely that he s actually got something on someone (or a lot of someones), but then again he really does sound like Trump blowing hot air and this could wind up being a huge nothingburger.He shut down before he  said too much  to his Twitter audience, and is now simply saying,  stay tuned.  So he s hinting that he and his  team  are going to bust something wide open. Because the scandal at Fox News can t possibly be a culture fostered by serial harasser Roger Ailes (and probably other serial harassers), could it?Featured image by Gerardo Mora via Getty Images",1,en

" Trump Goes Into Full Denial Mode During Temper Tantrum Over Historically Low Approval Rating. Donald Trump just refuses to admit that most Americans disapprove of him and his pathetic presidency.On Sunday, a new poll was released showing that Trump s approval rating had dropped to another historic low in the 70 year history of the poll.According to the ABC/Washington Post poll, only 36 percent of Americans approve of Trump, while a whopping 58 percent disapprove.That s the highest disapproval rating and lowest approval rating ever recorded by the poll.But Trump tried to sugercoat his numbers by rounding off his approval rating to 40 percent and actually had the gall to claim that the number  is not bad at this time.  Trump also attacked ABC and the Washington Post.The ABC/Washington Post Poll, even though almost 40% is not bad at this time, was just about the most inaccurate poll around election time!  Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) July 16, 2017Trump is in denial at this point. Just after his first 100 days, the same poll recorded a record low approval rating for a president just after the first 100 days. Now Trump has recorded the lowest approval rating for a president after just six months in office. Sad!These kinds of major polls are scientifically conducted and serve as a snapshot of American opinion during the given time-frame in which the poll was taken. This poll was taken in the days after Donald Trump Jr. released his damning email proving that the Trump campaign colluded with Russia and just after a trip abroad in which Trump embarrassed himself and the United States at the G-20 Summit.So Americans have a lot to disapprove of when it comes to Trump s performance in office.And Twitter users were quick remind Trump of the facts.Actually, Mr. President, people actually disapprove of you. The polls are not inaccurate. It is that you aren t competent or likeable.  Dani Bostick (@danibostick) July 16, 2017It is the worst approval rating of any president after 6 months in office in the history of the poll.  Morten  verbye (@morten) July 16, 2017It really is bad. pic.twitter.com/HICkS6I3fD  Morten  verbye (@morten) July 16, 2017 40% is not bad at this time ? What do les he mean? No president wants 40% approval ratings at any time in their presidency.  Robert Maguire (@RobertMaguire_) July 16, 2017For comparison, on nearly the exact same day in his presidency, the same poll had Obama w a 59% net approval https://t.co/4Ble0RFKrp pic.twitter.com/CeZlxG58c2  Robert Maguire (@RobertMaguire_) July 16, 2017 40% is not bad?

"Cambodia marks independence from France with doves, balloons. PHNOM PENH (Reuters) - Cambodians on Thursday marked the 64th anniversary of the country s independence from France by releasing doves and balloons into the sky at the Independence Monument in the capital Phnom Penh. Late King Norodom Sihanouk declared Cambodia s independence from France in 1953 after seizing power a year earlier in a bloodless coup, but maintained good relations with the European nation. Thursday s independence ceremony was attended by current King Norodom Sihamoni and Prime Minister Hun Sen, who has ruled Cambodia for more than 30 years, and was attended by thousands of school children, civil servants and foreign diplomats. Cambodia was under French rule for almost a century before its 1953 independence. Hun Sen in a Facebook post credited King Norodom Sihanouk with devoting his life to fight for the independence.  November 9 is the day that brought independence, territorial integrity, peace and development,  Hun Sen said. Hun Sen s ruling Cambodian People s Party has cracked down on the opposition in recent months in the lead up to a 2018 election. His government has asked the Supreme Court to dissolve the main opposition Cambodia National Rescue Party. A court ruling is expected to decide the matter next week. ",0,en

"TRUMP SAYS “NO” To Pro-Amnesty Koch Brother’s Influence…Won’t Meet With Them. Meanwhile, the Koch brothers are denying they were attempting to meet with Trump. They re probably too busy schmoozing with open-borders Paul Ryan and other more easily influenced politicians. Hillary will most surely be working overtime to capture those unspent millions that won t be going to Trump Trump tweeted this tonight:I turned down a meeting with Charles and David Koch. Much better for them to meet with the puppets of politics, they will do much better!  Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) July 30, 2016The Kochs are effectively indifferent between Trump and Clinton, though several Trump allies within the network have encouraged the billionaire donors to at least meet with the billionaire candidate. Donors who contribute at least $100,000 to the network are invited to hear from Charles Koch and Republican leaders both about the Kochs  political work along with their philanthropic and policy-focused spending.Some Koch donors, upset by the leadership s unwillingness to back the Republican nominee, have called for the Freedom Partners retreat to feature a poll to decide whether to marshal their resources toward his White House bid. But Holden said unequivocally that a decisive survey of that kind would not happen.May, 2014   Washington Post columnist Dana Milbank notes that,  More than 100 times on the Senate floor in the past few months, the Senate s top Democrat has invoked Charles and David Koch, the billionaire brothers who have pumped hundreds of millions of dollars into conservative causes and campaigns. According to Reid, the Koch brothers  are about as un-American as anyone I can imagine  and are attempting to  buy America.  Well, if it is true and what these billionaires are truly engaged in a diabolical plot to undermine the country, then Reid must count himself as one of their prime accomplices.Guess who is putting up lots of money to pressure House Republicans to pass a massive amnesty and immigration increase bill similar to the one Reid championed in the Senate? That would be none other than the Brothers Koch.   Immigration ReformThe Kochs have assembled a political operation some consider to be on par with the Republican National Committee, using a constellation of nonprofit organizations to drive elections and policy fights in recent years. They today have 1,200 paid staff members in 38 states.Yet their refusal to back Trump   whose language on immigration and trade is found to be too incendiary by the libertarian-inspired Kochs   is a leading reason why Trump is expected to be massively outgunned by Clinton and her allies in the advertising wars.The Koch network initially said they would spend $889 million in the lead-up to 2016, with about one-third of that figure dedicated to political activity. Yet Koch officials have scaled back their ambitions, with Holden saying Saturday that the sum was merely a  wish list number. They are now on pace to spend about $750 million, including about $250 million on politics.About $20 million in television has already aired, network officials said, with another $20 million still planned for the fall. The network is currently active in five Senate races, and is currently weighing how to get involved in one more: Marco Rubio s reelection fight in Florida. Via: wmtw TV",1,en

"WATCH: TRANSEXUAL MICHELLE OBAMA LOOK-ALIKE Kicked Out Of Girls Bathroom By Security Guard…Presses Charges. So it begins the suing of Americans who don t agree with Obama s dangerous decree that allows men to use the little girl s room at will. Will the first little girl who is raped in the Target bathroom receive the same media attention and compassion as this MAN will get from leftist LGBT agitators and progressive pigs of America? D.C. police have charged a security guard at a Giant grocery store with simple assault after a transgender woman said the guard forced her out of the women s restroom. Ebony Belcher, 32, said she went to the Giant in northeast D.C. with a friend to pick up a delivery from the Western Union.While at the Giant, she asked a store employee to point her to the restroom and passed a female security officer standing in the hallway. The officer came into the restroom and told her to get out, according to Belcher. Via: NBCWashingtonAlmost as disturbing as the transvestite who is eagerly using the little girls room (even though his genitals clearly show he is a male and should be using the bathroom with urinals), is Jackie Bensen, the woman reporting for News 4. Instead of reporting about a man who was invading the private space of women, she instead, chooses to behave as though she s just been exposed to a gruesome murder scene.We agree with the brilliant commentary on this issue by Rick Wells:Did the whole US sign up for some kind of voluntary brainwashing or mind control exercise without inviting me? As a similarly perplexed comedic genius once put it satirically,  What in the wide wide world of sports is a goin on here?  Now life has become stranger than fiction.The reporting and hand wringing would and should be laughable if it weren t so seriously deranged. Words have meaning and pronouns are words   he is for boys, those with  outie plumbing;  she is for girls, the ones with  innie plumbing.  It s no more complicated than that or at least there s no reason for it to be. Despite claims to the contrary, clothes do not make the man or the woman. The female reporter joins in, describing the bathroom user as a  transgender woman,  and using the female pronouns for the man. You mean the mentally unstable man dressed up as a woman who is lurking in about in the ladies  room, don t you, Miss liberal news reader? And aren t you being quite disingenuous? Wouldn t you want a pervert lurking around as you were taking care of your own private business to be redirected if you had been in that situation?According to the on the scene reporter, rather than thanking the security officer for protecting the space and the privacy of the real women from perverts pretending to be women, possible  hate crime  charges are being considered. That s good, make an example of this hero who stood up to the liberal bullying and turn women s rooms across America into pervert lounges. That s what the Marxists want, along with the complete emasculation of the American male population and manning-up of the girls.The reporter calls the pervert a  transgender woman  multiple times, misreporting the events. She says it was a  deeply humiliating  experience for the dude looks like a lady, which it should have been. Anywhere that man goes dressed up like a girl he should be embarrassed, it s abnormal.Even more embarrassing should be the fact that when he s dressed up like a girl he looks like a clone of another suspected transsexual, Michelle Obama. He s the spitting image right down to the overabundant teeth in his mouth and the freshly weed-whacked hairdo.His friend, identified as Earline  Bud  in the report, is another of the men parading as a woman though his size clearly restricts him to the handicapped stall of any facility he uses.

One year later, and Donald Trump s supporters couldn t be happier with their choice for President. Prepare for liberal heads to explode in 5 4 3 2 1According to a POLITICO/Morning Consult poll conducted on the eve of the first anniversary of Trump s historic election, 82 percent of those who say they supported Trump last year would vote for him again if they had to do it over. That s slightly more than those who say they would vote for Democrat Hillary Clinton again   78 percent   if they had the chance.Only 7 percent of Trump voters and 8 percent of Clinton voters say they would vote for a different candidate if they could complete their 2016 ballot again.Trump s supporters have largely rallied around the president, despite his poor overall approval ratings, the chaos of his first year in office and the ongoing investigations into Russian meddling in the 2016 election.But there are worrying signs for Trump that voters are less inclined to give him a second term three years from now if he decides to run for reelection.Those red flags go beyond the natural, downward trajectory of most new presidents. Like Trump, Barack Obama and George W. Bush saw their parties lose governorships in both New Jersey and Virginia the year after their first elections as president. But both Obama and Bush had job-approval ratings over 50 percent at this point.While most Trump voters would back him in a 2016 do-over, some defect when asked whether they will vote for Trump or a generic, unnamed Democrat in 2020. About three-quarters of Trump voters, 76 percent, back Trump in the 2020 matchup, while 8 percent would support the Democrat.  Politico",1,en

"Utah Republicans defend Romney after Bannon's 'Mormon' jab. WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Utah Republicans on Wednesday rallied around Mitt Romney, their party’s former presidential nominee, a day after former senior White House aide Steve Bannon accused him of having used his Mormon religion to avoid military service. Bannon’s attack on Romney’s character came in a fiery speech in Alabama where the former chief strategist for President Donald Trump was campaigning for Republican Senate candidate Roy Moore. “You avoided service, brother ... you hid behind your religion,” Bannon said at the rally, adding that Romney’s sons had also not served in the military and pointing to Moore’s service during the Vietnam War. The war of words was the latest episode highlighting the schism in the Republican party between establishment conservatives and the rise of Trump and his one-time strategist Bannon. Romney, 70, a former governor of Massachusetts who later moved to Utah, has mulled a run for the seat of Utah Republican U.S. Senator Orrin Hatch, 83, who is deciding whether to retire. Hatch was among Utah Republicans who came to Romney’s defense. “Bannon’s attacks ... are disappointing and unjustified,” said Hatch, a fellow Mormon like many in the state.  Utah Governor Gary Herbert, in a tweet, praised Romney and his family as honorable and said “Utahns reject the ugly politics and tactics of @SteveKBannon. #stayout.” “You can’t credibly call into question his patriotism or moral character—especially on the basis of his religious beliefs or his outstanding service as a missionary,” U.S. Senator Mike Lee also said, calling Romney “a good man.”     Romney, who lost the 2012 election to Democratic former president Barack Obama, has been a vocal critic of Trump as well as Bannon’s politics. Trump has fired back and criticized Romney’s failed presidential run.  Tensions between Trump and Romney have lingered even though Trump once considered him for secretary of state.  On Monday, Trump told reporters he wanted Hatch to seek re-election.  A day later, he called Romney, according to White House officials. “It was a good and positive conversation,” White House spokeswoman Sarah Sanders said. A source close to Romney confirmed the conversation, describing it as “a courtesy call.” ",0,en

" Trump Just Went Back On Another Election Vow, Decides To Keep DACA. In a shocking turn of events, the Trump administration has done something good. I know that s hard to imagine while Trump has been working to crackdown on immigration.According to the Washington Post, the Trump administration is leaving in place the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals program, or DACA, a program protecting hundreds of thousands young immigrants from deportation. It s also the very same program Trump had pledged to eliminate as a presidential candidate.Crazy, right?Referred to as  dreamers,  these young immigrants arrived in the U.S. as small children and raised in the U.S. For them there is no recollection of their former home country. To protect these young immigrants from deportation to a land they do not know, the DACA program was launched in 2012 and has since protected about 787,000 young immigrants from deportation.Despite Trump s vow, Homeland Security Secretary John Kelly quietly announced the decision to keep the program at the bottom of a fact sheet released late Thursday.Of course, there s a caveat to this program remaining in place. In the fact sheet, Kelly declared the end to Deferred Action for Parents of Americans, or DAPA, a similar, but never implemented program intended to shield immigrant parents of U.S. citizens and legal residents from deportation.No idea what made Trump and his administration change their mind on DACA but thankfully Obama s program will remain in place for young immigrants.Unfortunately, that s not the case for parents.DAPA was blocked by a federal judge in Texas after 26 states sued. The Washington Post goes on to say that  Republicans saw it as a  backdoor amnesty  and argued that Obama overstepped his authority by protecting a specific class of immigrants living in the United States illegally. Trump did mention in an Associated Press interview in April that his administration is  not after the dreamers, we are after the criminals  and  The Dreamers should rest easy. If that s the case, the question then becomes: why block it for parents? If they re not criminals, why shouldn t they get protection, too?Though we have a win, there s still much work to be done.Featured image via Diego G Diaz/Icon Sportswire via Getty Images",1,en

"Brazil struggles to help state dependent on Venezuela for power. SAO PAULO (Reuters) - The Brazilian government is looking at all options, including large batteries, to help northern Roraima state with power supplies after a series of blackouts in recent months largely related to its dependency on cash-strapped neighbor Venezuela. Roraima is the only Brazilian state not connected to the national power grid. Its capital, Boa Vista, and most other cities in the state are supplied by power produced in Venezuela and transmitted through a line that was opened in 2001. Documents produced by a Brazilian government committee monitoring the power sector show the state suffered 17 large-scale power outages since August. The documents, seen by Reuters, said only one instance was not related to Venezuela. The situation underscores how Venezuela s economic collapse is affecting its neighbors. Roraima is already dealing with a flood of Venezuelan migrants looking for food and work.  The economic situation in Venezuela is precarious, and it affects power line maintenance,   F bio Lopes Alves, electricity secretary at Brazil s Energy Ministry, told Reuters.  It is extremely worrying, we are studying how to assist them,  he said. The Energy and the Information ministries in Venezuela did not respond to requests for comment. A source at state-controlled Venezuelan power firm Corpoelec acknowledged that lack of maintenance is hurting Venezuela s power transmission system.   The dams are full of water, the rainy season has filled the dams, but the lack of maintenance means that we still have power outages,  the source said, asking not to be named because he was not authorized to speak about the issue. Brazil s government is evaluating quickly awarding licenses for companies to build local power generation projects of various types, including both renewable and non-renewable energy. It is also studying the possibility of buying large-scale batteries. Asked why Roraima is still not connected to the national power grid, Alves said a project for a new line awarded in 2011 to a consortium formed by Centrais El tricas Brasileiras SA and Alupar Investimento SA was never built because of difficulties obtaining environmental permits.  Roraima is home to some of the largest indigenous lands in Brazil, such as the Raposa Serra do Sol reserve with 1.74 million hectares (4.2 million acres), an area similar to that of Kuwait. The proposed line would cut through one of them. The government plans to award a new license early next year for the construction of a power line to connect Roraima to the grid, Alves said. ",0,en

"First ""I do"" as same-sex marriage comes to Germany. BERLIN (Reuters) - Same-sex couples married in Germany for the first time on Sunday, with several dozen couples tying the knot at civil registry offices that opened specially to mark the coming into force of a law passed by parliament in June. Among them were Karl Kreile, 59, and Bodo Mende, 60, who became Germany s first married gay couple, exchanging vows at the town hall in the Berlin borough of Schoeneberg on Sunday after 38 years together.  Yes, I do,  said Kreile, to applause from guests, before kissing his new husband. They then signed the marriage certificate. Later, guests feasted on a rainbow-colored wedding cake decorated with the slogan  Marriage for all . Speaking after the ceremony, Mende called for Germany and the European Union to do more to promote gay rights across Europe. Especially in more conservative regions of eastern Europe, acceptance of gay rights is still minimal.  We don t need to look far, just to the neighbor countries where the situation is more disturbing,  he said, an apparent reference to Poland and others where same-sex marriage is still not allowed. Earlier, he had described the campaign to achieve equal marriage in Germany as  25 years of hard struggle . Germany s parliament approved marriage equality in June after Chancellor Angela Merkel chose to make the vote a matter of conscience, freeing her Social Democrat coalition partners and many of her conservative lawmakers to vote for it.  Rights organizations say more needs to be done to achieve full equality. It is still impossible for children born into a lesbian couple to have both parents as a legal mother. Kreile and Mende, who registered their civil partnership 15 years ago, shortly after it became legal to do so in Germany, first tried to marry a quarter of a century ago.  I remember how it felt when we went to the registry office in Berlin Charlottenburg to request marriage,  said Kreile, describing a publicity-raising campaign he and his partner had participated in.  The official was nice, and so were the couples before and after us in the line, telling us:  We understand what you want.  But afterwards I still had to feel a sense of shame. I felt discriminated against, being sent out again,  he added. Some technical problems remain. The government s registry software recognizes only opposite-sex marriages and will only be updated next year. Until then, even same-sex couples will be recorded as  husband  and  wife . ",0,en

Once these fabricated talking points are circulated through the media, they later make their way into the mouths of politicians who repeat them incessantly, and in the case of the Senate and Congressional committee hearings on Russia and cabinet confirmation hearing   use the fake canards to bully people who are testifying on Capitol Hill. The fake  17 intelligence  agency claim was used by nearly everyone who used the hearings to grandstand and act tough on Russia, including pro-war Senators John McCain, Marco Rubio, Adam Schiff and countless others. It was also employed by Hillary Clinton, along with ever single panel  expert  on CNN and MSNBC who used the lie to prop-up their contrived and politicized narratives about how Russia hacked and influenced the 2016 election.What s more crucial though, is to realize the absolute key role to New York Times plays in this process of giving fake news the venire of officialdom at a government and mainstream level. They are a pivotal distribution point in the western propaganda dissemination machine   as nearly every US broadcast network across 4 time zones will routinely reference the New York Times as their primary source. 21WIRE has chronicled their exploits in helping to promote a series of illegal US-waged wars around the world.Consortium News Exclusive: A founding Russia-gate myth is that all 17 U.S. intelligence agencies agreed that Russia hacked into and distributed Democratic emails, a falsehood that The New York Times has belatedly retracted, reports Robert Parry Robert Parry  Consortium NewsThe New York Times has finally admitted that one of the favorite Russia-gate canards   that all 17 U.S. intelligence agencies concurred on the assessment of Russian hacking of Democratic emails   is false.On Thursday, the Times appended a correction to a June 25 article that had repeated the false claim, which has been used by Democrats and the mainstream media for months to brush aside any doubts about the foundation of the Russia-gate scandal and portray President Trump as delusional for doubting what all 17 intelligence agencies supposedly knew to be true.In the Times  White House Memo of June 25, correspondent Maggie Haberman mocked Trump for  still refus[ing] to acknowledge a basic fact agreed upon by 17 American intelligence agencies that he now oversees: Russia orchestrated the attacks, and did it to help get him elected. However, on Thursday, the Times   while leaving most of Haberman s ridicule of Trump in place   noted in a correction that the relevant intelligence  assessment was made by four intelligence agencies   the Office of the Director of National Intelligence, the Central Intelligence Agency, the Federal Bureau of Investigation and the National Security Agency. The assessment was not approved by all 17 organizations in the American intelligence community. The Times  grudging correction was vindication for some Russia-gate skeptics who had questioned the claim of a full-scale intelligence assessment, which would usually take the form of a National Intelligence Estimate (or NIE), a product that seeks out the views of the entire Intelligence Community and includes dissents.The reality of a more narrowly based Russia-gate assessment was admitted in May by President Obama s Director of National Intelligence James Clapper and Obama s CIA Director John Brennan in sworn congressional testimony.Clapper testified before a Senate Judiciary subcommittee on May 8 that the Russia-hacking claim came from a  special intelligence community assessment  (or ICA) produced by selected analysts from the CIA, NSA and FBI,  a coordinated product from three agencies   CIA, NSA, and the FBI   not all 17 components of the intelligence community,  the former DNI said.Clapper further acknowledged that the analysts who produced the Jan. 6 assessment on alleged Russian hacking were  hand-picked  from the CIA, FBI and NSA.Yet, as any intelligence expert will tell you, if you  hand-pick  the analysts, you are really hand-picking the conclusion. For instance, if the analysts were known to be hard-liners on Russia or supporters of Hillary Clinton, they could be expected to deliver the one-sided reportthat they did.Politicized IntelligenceIn the history of U.S. intelligence, we have seen how this selective approach has worked, such as the phony determination of the Reagan administration pinning the attempted assassination of Pope John Paul II and other acts of terror on the Soviet Union.CIA Director William Casey and Deputy Director Robert Gates shepherded the desired findings through the process by putting the assessment under the control of pliable analysts and sidelining those who objected to this politicization of intelligence.The point of enlisting the broader intelligence community   and incorporating dissents into a final report   is to guard against such  stove-piping  of intelligence that delivers the politically desired result but ultimately distorts reality.Another painful example of politicized intelligence was President George W. Bush s 2002 National Intelligence Estimate on Iraq s WMD that removed State Department and other dissents from the declassified version that was given to the public.Since Clapper s and Brennan s testimony in May, the Times and other mainstream news outlets have avoided a direct contradiction of their earlier acceptance of the 17-intelligence-agencies canard by simply referring to a judgment by  the intelligence community. That finessing of their earlier errors has allowed Hillary Clinton and other senior Democrats to continue referencing this fictional consensus without challenge, at least in the mainstream media.For instance, on May 31 at a technology conference in California, Clinton referred to the Jan. 6 report, asserting that  Seventeen agencies, all in agreement, which I know from my experience as a Senator and Secretary of State, is hard to get. They concluded with high confidence that the Russians ran an extensive information war campaign against my campaign, to influence voters in the election. The failure of the major news organizations to clarify this point about the 17 agencies may have contributed to Haberman s mistake on June 25 as she simply repeated the groupthink that nearly all the Important People in Washington just knew to be true.But the Times  belated correction also underscores the growing sense that the U.S. mainstream media has joined in a political vendetta against Trump and has cast aside professional standards to the point of repeating false claims designed to denigrate him.That, in turn, plays into Trump s Twitter complaints that he and his administration are the targets of a  witch hunt  led by the  fake news  media, a grievance that appears to be energizing his supporters and could discredit whatever ongoing investigations eventually conclude.Investigative reporter Robert Parry broke many of the Iran-Contra stories for The Associated Press and Newsweek in the 1980s.

" Courts Decide Conspiracy Nut Alex Jones Is Too Crazy To Raise His Own Kids (DETAILS). Alex Jones of the conspiracy theory website Infowars has made a literal career of spreading fake news and acting like a lunatic. It now seems that said career has come back to really bite him in the ass, since Jones just lost a court battle with his wife regarding which parent is most fit to raise their children. After more than nine hours of considering the merits of Jones  case, a jury returned, giving the estranged couple joint custody of the three children. Despite having joint custody, though, Jones  ex, Kelly Jones, will have most of the power.Prior to this battle, Alex Jones had the kids living with him, with their mother s rights being severely curtailed. She was only allowed supervised visits before. The reasons for this are unclear. She said tearfully to the press: I m so blessed to have such a wonderful support system and I just pray that what s happened to my family that people can understand what parental alienation syndrome is and get an awareness of it so we can stop this from happening to others. A lawyer for Kelly Jones, Robert Hoffman, said of Alex Jones: Mr. Jones is like a cult leader. And we ve seen the horrific damage cult leaders do to their followers. Indeed he is. Alex Jones whips his paranoid, ignorant followers up into a frenzy and makes them believe all kinds of tomfoolery. He has promoted the idea that the Sandy Hook Elementary School shooting never happened, that 9/11 was actually carried out by the United States government, and all kinds of other craziness, and his rabid audience believes every word of it. Definitely, such a person should not be influencing children.  At any rate, it is good to see that jury made the right choice here, and hopefully Kelly Jones can undo whatever damage her estranged husband did to those poor children.Featured image via screen capture from Infowars",1,en

"BATON ROUGE COP KILLER Had “Inspirational” YouTube Channel, Was Racist Member Of Farrakhan’s Nation Of ISLAM: “My Religion Is The Religion Of ‘Justice'” [VIDEO]. This cop killer was a hateful, racist sub-human. He not only hated white people and cops, he bragged about it. The scary thing is, much like ISIS, who has no trouble recruiting people with hate in their hearts, there are no shortage of people to carry out Obama s war on cops in America. These are terrorists and our very own  President  has inspired these people to act on their hate for Whites, for cops and for America. This, is Obama s real legacy The 29 year old ex-marine, Gavin Eugene Long, who ambushed and killed three unsuspecting Baton Rouge police officers on Sunday morning, hated those who did not share his skin-tone and harbored a particular hatred for the police. As revealed in the hours after the shootings, a Youtube account operated by Long under the handle I Am Cosmo where the alleged killer posted dozens of clips, provides insight into what motivated the young man to kill three police officers and wound three more on his 29th birthday.In the Youtube videos, Long rants against  crackers, and makes multiple references to the July 5th killing of Alton Sterling at the hands of police officers only five miles away from Sunday s attack. The videos also detail that Long is a member of the Nation of Islam, labelled a hate group by the Southern Poverty Law Center for its black supremacist and racist views towards Jews, Asians, and whites which the group s leaders argue have  sucked the blood from and exploited the black community.As Daily Caller details, the 29-year-old was a native of Kansas City, Missouri and was honorably discharged from the Marines in 2010 after reaching the rank of E-5. He preferred to go by the name Cosmo Ausar Setepenra rather than Gavin Eugene Long.In a video published on Thursday, the racist shooter says that  If I would have been there with Alton   Clap  before promoting a book that he wrote that discusses black liberation ideology.  I wrote it for my dark-skinned brothers,  said Long.  If you look at all the rebels like Black Panthers, Huey P. Newton, Malcolm X, and Elijah Muhammad, they was light-skinned. But we know how hard y all got it. https://youtu.be/kGuUq6eUoFwThe assailant also suggested that the black community should buy only from black-owned businesses rather than  working for the white people. In one video Long is heard lamented  working for the white people.  He encouraged one man riding in his vehicle as he filmed using a body camera to shop only at black-owned businesses. He brought up a hypothetical scenario in which a family member who wanted to buy carpet was forced to buy from non-black business owners saying    Who s she going to f  with? The cracker, the Arab, the Chinese? These Arabs, these Indians, they don t give two fucks about us,  said the shooter.Come to think of it, he may have a point.

"WHY DID THE UN HAVE A PRO-GUN CONTROL MEETING AT SPA IN MEXICO And Why Weren’t Dissenters Allowed?. Government officials using other people s money to enjoy a swanky seaside vacation in Mexico while discussing how to take away our right to bear arms Sounds about right The first annual meeting of the nations that have ratified the 2014 Arms Trade Treaty (ATT) opened on Monday, August 24 at a spa in Canc n, Mexico. The treaty s been controversial in the U.S. from the moment negotiations on it began, and this meeting will surely stoke the suspicions of those who think the treaty s real aim is to crimp America s sovereignty and constitutional liberties.The meeting was originally supposed to be in Mexico City, but wouldn t you rather spend your off-hours by the pool?Of course, you may think it s weird, or sick, that all these nations pretend to believe that the best place to discuss the arms trade is at a seaside resort. After all, many of them spend all their time pleading poverty and demanding aid from the U.S. to implement the treaty.But frankly, they don t care how bad it looks. They ve got a great boondoggle going, and no one s going to spoil it for them.But everyone s going to Mexico not just because it s got great beaches. Mexico has been one of the leading campaigners for the ATT. It wants to use the treaty to promote gun control in the U.S.Mexico s theory is that, since any gun in the U.S. might at some point conceivably cross the U.S. border, all U.S. guns have to be controlled in the name of controlling the international arms trade. That s not going to happen at this meeting (or ever, if the U.S. retains its sanity).But Mexico, the other nations that agree with it, and  progressive  groups that campaigned for the treaty the blame-America-first activists, in other words are in this game for the long haul. So it s not a good sign that Mexico s been given the job of hosting the first treaty meeting.It s even less good that Mexico s spent much of the past year colluding with the activists to keep skeptics (like myself) out of the room. Their view was that only true believers who campaigned for the treaty should be allowed to see what s going on.You might wonder what they re afraid of. We skeptics make no secret of our views, but we re a well-mannered bunch: no spitballs. However, if we were always in the room, we d report on exactly how closely the activists are working with Mexico and other likeminded nations.The activists led by the global Control Arms Coalition, which has a massive presence at Canc n are the only insiders in the treaty process, and they want to keep it that way.The ATT was adopted through the U.N., which means it was drafted by the world s nations. That s bad, because there are lots of incapable and evil governments in the world. But it s better than the alternative, which was for the ATT to have been drafted solely by the activists.Now that the treaty exists, however, the activists want to take it over and direct it for their own purposes. What they want is to turn the ATT into an arms control and disarmament treaty.Keeping skeptics away is part of that campaign.So far, they ve not succeeded in keeping us out, or in taking over the treaty. But the ATT isn t simply a treaty that s over and done with. Like many treaties, it s a process that will go on and on, in meeting after meeting, year after year. And the activists have lots of people, lots of money, and lots of time.The U.S. s goal in Canc n should be to do whatever it can to prevent the activists from getting any footholds. That means ensuring a treaty secretariat that s strictly limited in its purposes, conference rules that don t privilege the activists, and reporting requirements that don t go beyond current U.S. practice or identify individual U.S. firearms owners.Via: Daily Signal",1,en

"NOT KIDDING! Serial Liar Brian Williams Blames “FAKE NEWS” For Hillary’s Loss On MSNBC Last Night [VIDEO]. The man suspended from his TV anchor job for faking his own news is furious about the spread of  fake news. Brian Williams, who was forced to take a 6-month vacation before being permanently relieved of his  Nightly News  duties on NBC, railed about the new epidemic of  fake news  in his MSNBC show earlier this week. Fake news played a role in this election and continues to find a wide audience,  Williams whined Tuesday night in his middle-of-the-night show.Specifically, Williams singled out Trump s incoming national security adviser, Lt. Gen. Michael Flynn, and his son for spreading falsehoods. Williams is no stranger to fake news. He was punished in February 2015 for lying about a helicopter ride in Iraq that he claimed came under heavy enemy fire.In 2003, Williams and an NBC team were reporting in Iraq when three Chinook helicopters came under fire.Williams claimed he was on one of the copters that were hit, when he aboard a different helicopter located about an hour behind the other three. I don t know what screwed up in my mind that caused me to conflate one aircraft with another,  Williams told  Stars and Stripes  after crew members from the helicopters that were hit that day came forward.Questions were also raised about Williams  coverage in the aftermath of Hurricane Katrina in New Orleans in 2005.Williams claimed he could see bodies in flooding from his hotel room in the French Quarter.But the New Orleans Advocate reported that the French Quarter was largely spared in the catastrophe and saw little flooding.-NYP",1,en
"HIGH-LEVEL WHISTLEBLOWER Exposes Astonishing Evidence Of Exaggerated Global Warming Data Used To DUPE World Leaders Into Investing Billions. This isn t the first time  scientists  have been caught manipulating evidence in their quest to convince the world global, warming, cooling, climate change is real, and it certainly won t be the last.Thank goodness for whistleblowers The UK Daily Mail on Sunday today revealed astonishing evidence that the organization that is the world s leading source of climate data rushed to publish a landmark paper that exaggerated global warming and was timed to influence the historic Paris Agreement on climate change.A high-level whistleblower has told this newspaper that America s National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) breached its own rules on scientific integrity when it published the sensational but flawed report, aimed at making the maximum possible impact on world leaders including Barack Obama and David Cameron at the UN climate conference in Paris in 2015.The report claimed that the  pause  or  slowdown  in global warming in the period since 1998   revealed by UN scientists in 2013   never existed, and that world temperatures had been rising faster than scientists expected. Launched by NOAA with a public relations fanfare, it was splashed across the world s media, and cited repeatedly by politicians and policy makers.But the whistleblower, Dr John Bates, a top NOAA scientist with an impeccable reputation, has shown The Mail on Sunday irrefutable evidence that the paper was based on misleading,  unverified  data.It was never subjected to NOAA s rigorous internal evaluation process   which Dr Bates devised.His vehement objections to the publication of the faulty data were overridden by his NOAA superiors in what he describes as a  blatant attempt to intensify the impact  of what became known as the Pausebuster paper.His disclosures are likely to stiffen President Trump s determination to enact his pledges to reverse his predecessor s  green  policies, and to withdraw from the Paris deal   so triggering an intense political row.

"Iraqi forces capture Akkas gas field from Islamic State: minister. BAGHDAD (Reuters) - Iraqi forces captured the Akkas gas field from Islamic State on Thursday, Oil Minister Jabar al-Luaibi told reporters in Baghdad. Iraqi forces launched an offensive last month to oust the militant group from the last area still under its control in Iraq, on the border with Syria, where the field is located. The field hasn t entered production yet. Akkas, which has reserves of 5.6 trillion cubic feet, is operated by Korea Gas Company (KOGAS) and located in western Anbar province near the Syrian border. Development of Iraq s Akkas gas field had been delayed after Islamic State seized large territories in Anbar in May 2014. KOGAS halted operations after multiple attacks by militants against the company s sites in the field. Iraqi oil ministry officials said they plan to send a crew to Akkas to assess damages to the field s energy facilities.  We will make a field visit to write a report about the damages and what we need to bring back the field online as soon as possible,  said engineer Mohammed Ibrahim who is a member of an oil ministry team supervising Akkas. Iraq is planning to contact KOGAS soon to start preparations to resume development works at the field, said Ibrahim.  Security forces are working to clean Akkas from landmines and booby-traps that might be left by Daesh,  said Colonel Saad Hardan from Anbar police. ",0,en

" Alabama Republicans Just Proved They Hate Local Democracy And The Working Class (VIDEO). Republicans in Alabama just proved how scared they are of working class people organizing and demanding fair wages. The working class has been emboldened by the success of the Fight for $15 movement. They have successfully raised the minimum wage in cities and states all across the United States.The city of Birmingham raised their local minimum wage to $10.10 per hour last August. The wage increase was supposed to take place in July. That wage increase, however, will not be happening. That s because last Thursday, Alabama s Republican-controlled state government passed a bill to take away the city s power to raise their own minimum wage. The governor believes the minimum wage should be uniform across every area in Alabama,  spokeswoman Jennifer Ardis told the Associated Press.According to CBS News, Alabama s Senate passed the measure and the governor, Robert Bentley, signed the legislation an hour later. That means that workers in Alabama will still receive the federal minimum wage of $7.25 per hour. Alabama is one of only five states that does not have a minimum wage set higher than the federal minimum wage that employers can pay their workers.Birmingham City Council President Johnathan Austin said: Governor Bentley and the Republican-controlled Alabama Legislature dealt a severe blow to the working-class citizens of this state and in particular, the working poor in the City of Birmingham. Once again the GOP has stood with large corporations and the wealthy while telling the average working Alabamian that they re not important. This is a tactic that Republicans have been using to try and halt the progression of the new worker s rights movement that has risen up to demand fair wages. Alabama now joins sixteen other states who have passed laws that prevent cities from raising their minimum wage.It isn t surprising that Republicans are using this tactic. Initiatives to raise the minimum wage have been extremely effective at the local level of government. Huge cities like Seattle, San Francisco, and Los Angeles have successfully passed laws that raise the minimum wage to $15 per hour.You can watch a report on the story, below.

There has also been a Whitehouse.gov petition to classify Return of Kings group as a terrorist organization. There was even a safety alert posted to social media by local police warning women to steer clear, and saying that there is concern that this may be a ruse to commit rape. Even heavily conservative Texas Governor Greg Abbott has come out in strong condemnation against the group when he learned of their plans to hold meetings in Texas, saying in a statement: This pathetic group and their disgusting viewpoints are not welcome in Texas. I ve spent much of my career protecting women from such vile and heinous acts, and it won t be any different on my watch as Governor. After the outrage continued, Roosh V. finally released the following statement, announcing the cancellation of all of the meetups: I can no longer guarantee the safety or privacy of the men who want to attend on February 6, especially since most of the meetups can not be made private in time. While I can t stop men who want to continue meeting in private groups, there will be no official Return Of Kings meetups. The listing page has been scrubbed of all locations. I apologize to all the supporters who are let down by my decision. While your fellow misogynists may be let down, Roosh, the rest of the world is breathing a collective sigh of relief.

" Trump Staffers Admit Their Boss Has No Idea What DACA Is. Donald Trump sent a racist elf to make the announcement that his administration is going to punish 800,000 young people, who came to the U.S. as children, and subject them to deportation in an act that Attorney General Jeff Sessions called  compassionate. The Obama-era Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals program, also known as DACA, is being terminated by a man who doesn t know what the program is, according to Trump s own administration officials, who said he doesn t fully comprehend what the move to eliminate DACA would mean.According to the New York Times, it was just an hour before the announcement that Trump administration officials privately expressed concern that the former reality show star might not fully grasp the details of the steps he was about to take, and when he discovered their full impact, would change his mind.Trump did not have the courage to face the nation and make the announcement himself and left Sessions to do his dirty work.The perpetrators behind pushing Trump to eliminate the program include Stephen Miller   the amateur president s chief domestic policy aide   who wrote the Trump campaign s immigration plan promising the termination of DACA, and has played a pivotal role inside the White House in pushing Trump to roll back the provision, according to Politico.Steve Bannon and Attorney General Jeff Sessions, the latter of which just made the announcement, have also been against the program, even though ending it would hurt the economy.Trump, without even comprehending how upending the program would affect the economy as well as tear families apart, allowed three extremists to call the shots instead of trying to unify the country while it was just besieged by one deadly hurricane   and another category 5 storm is on its way.Bannon and Sessions both believe that Trump s rise is credited to his stance on immigration, however, the former reality show star told DREAMers recently to  rest easy  because his administration would not kick them out of the country. Just a few days ago, Trump said,  We love the DREAMers! Photo by Andrew Harrer-Pool/Getty Images",1,en
"TSA: US Residents from 9 States Will Need Passports for Domestic Flights. This latest move by America s notorious Transportation Security Authority (TSA) seems to be step one in a move towards a national ID Card, complete with biometrics and embedded RFID technology.By forcing residents of nine states to get passports in order to board domestic flights, the TSA is de facto pushing those states towards the implementation of a new state-of-the-art ID card system.This will help to give real teeth to the  The Real ID Act It s just the next phase in the further militarization of US society.Forbes reports You may have thought you don t need a passport because you don t travel outside the United States. But for residents of nine states, that will change at the beginning of 2018 for any commercial flight, whether international or domestic.Nine states will no longer allow travelers to board an airplane with just their state issued driver s licenses as of January 22, 2018. To get past TSA security checkpoints, another form of identification will be required: passport, permanent resident card/green card or a military ID.The Real ID Act of 2005 states that state-issued IDs from these nine states do not meet the minimum security standards of the federal government:With just a few months until the Real ID Act goes into full effect, it is time to start planning now and look into getting your passport. Here is the airport signage, placed around the security checkpoints in airports to remind U.S. travelers of what;s to come (with my emphasis): Starting January 22, 2018, you will need a driver s license or ID from a state compliant with the REAL ID ACT, a state that has an extension for compliance, or an alternate ID to fly. For REAL ID information, and a list of acceptable IDs, visit tsa.gov.  Some states have started working on offering federally approved issued IDs that would not require a passport for domestic air travel. Check with your local government office to see if there is a different type of ID you can apply for, and the TSA website to clarify this situation. Because on January 22, 2018, the enforcement for those nine states will go into effect, and by 2020, even more people will end up needing a passport, as confirmed by the official website of the Transportation Security Administration.To repeat, if you re going to take a flight and you have a state-issued ID from one of those nine states listed above, unless your state has made federally approved changes before January, you should use a passport to go anywhere across the country, as all domestic travel is included in these new standards.

The decision breaks with decades of U.S. policy and risks fuelling violence in the Middle East.

" President Obama Stuns Oil Companies With Crushing Proposal (VIDEO). President Obama just announced another major shakeup in the last year of his presidency, and the oil companies aren t liking it   that much is for sure. On Thursday, Obama revealed his plan to place a $10 fee on every single barrel of oil produced in the country. Considering the current U.S. crude trading price of $31.72 a gallon, that s a pretty hefty tax.Also   this appears to be a death tax to oil entirely. And, it could make life for the oil companies unbearable. Remember   just one year ago, oil was going for nearly twice as much as what it is now. While in the midterm oil will fluctuate up and down, over time it s trajectory has been going downward. Who knows what the price of oil will be when the tax proposal goes through, if ever?While Republicans still control a majority of Congress and refuse to take up the proposal, Obama s declaration to get rid of oil has already had its impact on the markets. It didn t even take one day and already oil is down 2 percent after the announcement.Keep in mind, Russia and Iran   two major countries that Republicans say are our bitter enemies   well   their entire economies rely heavily on oil. When oil does bad, so do their pockets. Divesting ourselves from oil is a national security concern. If anything, Republicans are hurting our national security from this viewpoint.The idea is not just to penalize oil companies and Republicans (that s wishful thinking) though, the real issue here is thinking about the future of America s energy and what s in the country s best interest. Green energy is; carbon isn t.Here s what Obama plans to do with the money raised from the new tax:-Invest $20 billion to reduce traffic and improve commuting. Think about that   that s more funding than the EPA and Interior Department combined. A lot of this money will go towards alternative transportation options. Think about the Hyperloop being constructed between Los Angeles and San Francisco by billionaire Elon Musk. It s supposed to completely alter our thinking about traveling long distances entirely. And   it s 100% green. That s what this country needs.-Invest $10 billion into state and local transportation and climate programs.-Put $2 billion into research for clean vehicles and aircraft.The White House sees this as the first step in an ambitious new plan for the 21st Century of clean transportation: By placing a fee on oil, the president s plan creates a clear incentive for private-sector innovation to reduce our reliance on oil and at the same time invests in clean energy technologies that will power our future. Former Governor Ed Rendell of Pennsylvania is calling Obama s plan the boldest transportation blueprint since Eisenhower. Considering many think Eisenhower is the last great Republican president to take the oath of office, that s quite the compliment. Since then we ve just been bumping along, doing short-term fixes, and I give them a lot of credit for laying out this kind of long-term investment. I also give them credit for having the guts to say how they would pay for it all. That s very unusual in this area. While it may not pass muster in Congress, that s not what matters here. This proposal is a vision for the future of the country. And, it makes sense. The only thing that s going to get something like this implemented in Congress is voters going to the polls and voting overwhelmingly to fire Republicans on the Hill, as well as seeing to it that a Democrat is sworn in as president. Only then will people be able to follow through on this future vision of change for our country. And, in the meantime, it is kind of fun pissing the oil companies and Republicans off by talking about it.Featured image from Public Domain Files",1,en

" WATCH: Bill Maher Doesn’t Hold Back Defending Bernie Sanders On Foreign Policy. During a segment of Real Time with Bill Maher, the comedic host went all out in his defense of Bernie Sanders  foreign policy experience.During the segment, the lefties at the table agreed that Sanders is excellent on economic issues. Though some seemed skeptical that Sanders has the same grasp of foreign policy issues.  Maher was asked by MSNBC s Alex Wagner if he seriously thinks that Sanders is fit to lead the nation as president when it comes to foreign policy matters. Wagner asks Maher: Do you want Bernie Sanders getting off Air Force One, making a deal on foreign police with ? Do you think he s at the level that we need? Maher responds to Wagner s question, saying: Fuck yeah! The guy who voted right on the Iraq war? Yea, I do. Then, Armstrong Williams, an advisor for Ben Carson, decided to chime in. Williams implies that it doesn t actually matter how well Sanders knows foreign policy. That s because Sanders would be surrounded by experts.Maher says that might be good enough for Carson, who once repeatedly and publicly referred to Hamas, as  Hummus.  Maher recounts the time that Carson said that we need to build a coalition of Arab nations, in order to combat the Islamic State. When asked what nations he would have been a part of this coalition, Carson couldn t name a single nation.The idea that Sanders wouldn t be strong on foreign policy issues is ridiculous. Both Hillary Clinton and Sanders, have not been extremely illustrative about their views on foreign policy. That might have to do with the fact that Democrats are not that passionate about foreign policy issues this election cycle. There may be a few areas where the two candidates diverge, though, they both seem to mainly differentiate themselves by tone on issues like the Islamic State.You can watch the segment from the show, below.https://youtu.be/62YiMIGmAdc?t=4s Featured image from video screenshot via YouTube.",1,en

" Cher Does NOT Hold Back On Twitter As She Calls For Death Of Michigan Governor (TWEETS). When it comes to the safety of our drinking water that comes out of our taps, we are left to trust those who are elected to keep us safe and work in our best interests. However, what s been happening in Flint, Michigan over the past few years is criminal. Flint s city manager was held accountable to Gov. Rick Snyder (R) alone. They, alongside other officials denied that there was lead contamination in the Flint s water.As Rachel Maddow reported: For more than 18 months, state and local government officials ignored irrefutable evidence that the water pumped from the Flint River exposed [residents] to extreme toxicity,  the complaint reads.  The deliberately false denials about the safety of the Flint River water was as deadly as it was arrogant. Calling officials  conduct  so egregious and so outrageous that it shocks the conscience,  the complaint cites the specific experiences of a few plaintiffs and their families, all of whom allege they have been challenged by similar health ailments since high levels of lead and copper entered their bloodstreams.These conditions include skin lesions, hair loss, chemical-induced hypertension, vision loss and depression. Of the four families described in the complaint, two had ceased to drink Flint water after a certain point   and used it only for washing and cooking   but still said they were exposed to many of the same ill effects. Finally admitting to the toxicity in Flint, Snyder declared a state of emergency and apologized, but for many it is too late. The U.S. Justice Department has now opened an investigation into how things could have gone so devastatingly wrong for so long. This is following an EPA investigation that began last November.Needless to say, people are utterly outraged, and justifiably so.Taking to Twitter, legendary artist Cher called Snyder out by name and asked that he be jailed. Then going a step further, called for the death penalty. She said: Gov. of Michigan is a murderer. HE made the decision to give people poison water, and now must sign disaster bill. Children will  never  recover. #jailforRick WTF is going on with power. Mad, greed driven, killer. Incompetent politicians? They are criminals! Gov. Rick Snyder of Michigan. #firingsquadworksforme GOV.Of MICHIGAN IS A MURDERER?HE Made Decision 2GAVE ppl POISON WATER,&NOW MUST SIGN DISASTER BILL.CHILDREN WILL""NEVER""RECOVER? #JAILFORRICK  Cher (@cher) January 6, 2016WTF IS GOING ON W/POWER MAD,GREED DRIVEN,KILLER, INCOMPETENT,POLITICIANS?THEY R CRIMNALS  GOV.RICK SNYDER OF MICH. #FIRINGSQUADWORKSFORME  Cher (@cher) January 6, 2016And while asking for a firing squad could seem a bit over the line, the passion behind her tweets is palpable.

"Trump opponents urge U.S. Supreme Court to rule on travel ban. WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Challengers to President Donald Trump’s travel ban targeting several Muslim-majority countries on Thursday urged the U.S. Supreme Court to decide the policy’s legality even though it has been replaced with a revised plan. In separate letters to the court, the American Civil Liberties Union and the state of Hawaii said the justices  should still hear the case, which had been scheduled for arguments next week but was taken off their calendar after the administration announced the reworked ban last month. The challengers, characterizing the new ban as an indefinite extension of the previous one, said individuals who sued have an interest in the expired measure being declared unlawful because they continue to be harmed by the new policy.  Hawaii also told the court in a separate letter that it intended to challenge Trump’s latest travel ban by seeking on Friday to amend its existing lawsuit against the previous one. The Justice Department urged the justices not to hear the case, to throw out earlier lower court rulings that had invalidated the ban and to order that the legal challenges be dismissed. Trump’s three successive moves to block entry into the United States by people from several predominantly Muslim countries have been among his most contentious acts since taking office in January. Trump had promised as a candidate “a total and complete shutdown of Muslims entering the United States.”  The ACLU told the court that the plaintiffs who sued to stop the policy “retain an all-too-real stake in the outcome of the case” even though the original 90-day travel ban on people from six countries expired on Sept. 24. That order was signed by Trump in March and was enacted with some changes in June with the high court’s blessing. The justices on Sept. 25 asked all the parties to file court papers expressing views on whether the case was moot, meaning there was nothing left to decide, because the temporary ban expired. That ban had targeted people from Iran, Libya, Syria, Yemen, Somalia and Sudan. The new open-ended ban announced in a presidential proclamation on Sept. 24 removed Sudan from the list and blocked people from Chad and North Korea and certain government officials from Venezuela from entering the United States. Among the issues raised by the challengers is whether the ban discriminated against Muslims in violation of the U.S. Constitution’s prohibition on the government favoring or disfavoring a particular religion. A separate 120-day ban on refugees entering the United States that was part of Trump’s March order expires on Oct. 24. Hawaii’s lawyers said that even if the high court decided not to issue a ruling, it should still leave the lower court decisions in place. To do otherwise would allow the administration to effectively win the case by erasing rulings that had gone against Trump, Hawaii argued. The Justice Department said that it wants the lower court rulings tossed because the challengers will otherwise cite them in new litigation against Trump’s reworked ban. “The lower courts should be considering challenges to the proclamation anew based on its text, operation, and findings,” Justice Department lawyers wrote. The weekly behind-closed-doors meeting in which the justices consider next steps in cases before them is scheduled for Friday morning. The court could make an announcement at any time. The new ban could affect tens of thousands of potential immigrants and visitors to the United States. Opponents have said that like the earlier two orders from January and March, it was still effectively a “Muslim ban.”  Even if the Supreme Court dismissed the older case, it may still have to weigh in on the issue in the future. Various challengers have filed suit against the reworked ban, and those cases potentially could reach the high court. ",0,en

" Geraldo Rivera To San Juan Mayor Carmen Yulín Cruz: ‘I Don’t See People Dying’ (VIDEO). The way in which Donald Trump has handled the aftermath of Hurricane Maria s impact on Puerto Rico, an unincorporated territory of the United States, has been nothing short of terrible and incompetent, leading many to question his ability to even locate Puerto Rico on a map. The only thing more disgusting than the actions of President Trump is the behavior of his blind followers and Fox News reporter and former talk show host Geraldo Rivera set the bar relatively low recently.San Juan Mayor Carmen Yul n Cruz reached out to Trump first by pleading in an interview for him to  save us from dying,  but to no avail. Cruz then tried in the only way proven effective, by taking to Twitter almost a week after Hurricane Maria, the strongest hurricane to make landfall in Puerto Rico since 1928, struck the country and left most of the population without power or fresh water. She began by retweeting the pleas of others and then attempted to get Trump s attention directly:Se or Presidente no eliminar las leyes de cabotaje es inmoral. Es un acto de opresi n financiera que solo lograr  agravar nuestra crisis. pic.twitter.com/6UujyEUlTD  Carmen Yul n Cruz (@CarmenYulinCruz) September 28, 2017Her first tweet to Trump was a plea to eliminate the Jones Act, an outdated and antiquated maritime law requiring all goods transported by water between US ports be carried on US-flag ships, constructed in the United States, owned by US citizens, and crewed by US citizens and US permanent residents, a law that is drastically holding up relief efforts. Cruz s tweet read in Spanish,  Mr. President, not to eliminate the laws of cabotage is immoral. It is an act of financial oppression that will only aggravate our crisis.  It is almost certain that Trump can t read Spanish or comprehend the fact that Cabotage is a real term to refer to coastal navigation and trade, so naturally, he saw this as an insult:The Mayor of San Juan, who was very complimentary only a few days ago, has now been told by the Democrats that you must be nasty to Trump.  Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) September 30, 2017 Such poor leadership ability by the Mayor of San Juan, and others in Puerto Rico, who are not able to get their workers to help. They .  Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) September 30, 2017 want everything to be done for them when it should be a community effort. 10,000 Federal workers now on Island doing a fantastic job.  Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) September 30, 2017While Trump put off visiting Puerto Rico for another week, Geraldo Rivera decided to make the trip on behalf of Fox News to see what Cruz was so concerned about. There are all people at all municipalities literally starving, dehydrating,  Cruz told Rivera.  We have had our hospital try to go back to speed but then the electricity goes off and we have to do all the bacteria testing, which takes three to four days. Geraldo wasn t convinced and felt the need to interject. But are people dying?  he interrupted.  I ve been traveling around, I don t see people dying. I spoke to the doctors, they say they saw 53 patients and they had a person who was septic, but nobody dying. Mayor Cruz tried her best to reason with the mustachioed one. Dying is a continuum,  she explained.  If you don t get fed for seven, eight days and you re a child, you are dying. If you have 11 people   like we took out of a nursing home   severely dehydrated, you are dying. Watch the madness unfold below and, in case you were wondering, the death toll in Puerto Rico due to Hurricane Maria stood at 16 as of Sunday with only nine hospitals connected to the electric grid.Featured image via screenshot",1,en

"New U.S. environmental chief says agency can also be pro-jobs. WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The new head of the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency said on Tuesday that America need not choose between jobs and the environment, in a nod to the energy industry, as the White House prepares executive orders that could come as soon as this week to roll back Obama-era regulation.  “I believe that we as an agency, and we as a nation, can be both pro-energy and jobs, and pro-environment,” Scott Pruitt  said in his first address to staff. “We don’t have to choose between the two.”   Critics of the agency have complained that regulations ushered in by former Democratic President Barack Obama have killed thousands of energy jobs by restricting carbon emissions and limiting areas open to coal mining and oil drilling. Democrats, environmental advocates and many of the EPA’s current and former staff worry President Donald Trump’s appointment of Pruitt signals a reversal in America’s progress toward cleaner air and water and fighting global climate change. Both Trump and Pruitt have expressed doubts about climate change, and Trump vowed during his 2016 presidential campaign to pull the United States out of a global pact to fight it. The Republican president has promised to slash environmental rules to help the drilling and mining industries, but without hurting air and water quality. Pruitt sued the agency he now leads more than a dozen times while attorney general of Oklahoma to stop federal rules. He did not mention climate change in his 12-minute speech at the EPA’s headquarters in Washington.  He struck a conciliatory tone in the address,  saying he would “listen, learn and lead” and that he valued the contributions of career staff.  Trump is expected to sign executive orders aimed at reshaping environmental policy as early as this week. Those orders would lift a ban on coal mining leases on federal lands and ease greenhouse gas emissions curbs on electric utilities, according to a report by the Washington Post. They would also require changes to Obama’s Waters of the United States rule that details which waterways fall under federal protection, the report said. The White House did not immediately reply to a request for comment on the Washington Post story. Pruitt was confirmed by the U.S. Senate last week after contentious hearings that focused on his record as the top prosecutor of the oil- and gas-producing state of Oklahoma.  Democrats had sought to delay Pruitt’s confirmation over questions about his ties to the oil industry. Some 800 former EPA staff also signed a letter urging senators to reject him, and about 30 current EPA staff joined a protest set up in Chicago by the Sierra Club environmental group. In Oklahoma, a state judge ruled last week that Pruitt would have to turn over emails between his office and energy companies by Tuesday after a watchdog group, the Center for Media and Democracy, sued for their release. The judge will review and perhaps hold back some of the emails before releasing them, a court clerk said.       Nicole Cantello, a representative of the union that represents EPA workers, said that despite Pruitt’s record, she was hoping for the best.  “One would hope that the administrator would learn about what we do and would then not treat as lightly the EPA’s mission and accomplishments, and what it is required to do under the statutes,” she said.     The American Petroleum Institute, an industry group, said it looked forward to working with Pruitt, the administration and Congress “on policies that will keep energy affordable, create jobs, and strengthen our economy.” ",0,en

" FIVE Federal Judges Admit That California Is About To Execute ‘An Innocent Man’. Thirty years ago, the state of California sentenced Kevin Cooper to death. In 2004, his life was spared just hours before he was supposed to be executed. But now, more than a decade later, in a matter of weeks,  he is once again facing lethal injection and even a federal judge agrees that he may be innocent.In 1983, Cooper escaped a maximum security prison and was holed up in an abandoned house hiding from authorities. While he was hiding out in the house, two adults and two small children, just a short distance away in the Chino Hills suburb of Los Angeles were being murdered. When police found the bodies of Douglas and Peggy Ryen, their 10-year-old daughter Jessica, and 10-year-old Chris Hughes they zeroed in on Cooper as the suspect. He was eventually convicted of the crimes and sentenced to death despite an overwhelming amount of evidence that he did not commit the murders.There was one survivor, a then 8-year-old Josh Ryen who had his throat cut and was left for dead. When Josh Ryen recovered from his injuries, he stated that it was three white or Hispanic men that attacked and killed his family and that Cooper was not involved. This started a chain of events that reveal a 30 year cover up and blatant falsification of evidence by police and the prosecutor s office in San Bernadino County.In addition to the child s statement (which he later changed), there was another suspect. When the Ryens were murdered, their station wagon was stolen and witnesses reported that they d seen three men in a vehicle matching its description near the crime. Furthermore, the ex-wife of a white supremacist (Lee Furrow) told the police that her ex had come home wearing bloody pants after the murder. She also said that a hatchet was missing from her home. She gave the police the pants and they never tested them for DNA. Finally, police also found the blood of two other people who did not match Cooper or the victims at the crime scene.Cooper appealed his conviction and although the Ninth Circuit Court upheld the conviction, five federal judges wrote a 103-page dissent, saying: There is no way to say this politely. The district court failed to provide Cooper a fair hearing. The district court impeded and obstructed Cooper s attorneys at every turn. [T]he court imposed unreasonable conditions, refused discovery that should have been available as a matter of course; limited testimony that should not have been limited; and found facts unreasonably, based on a truncated and distorted record. Public confidence in the proper administration of the death penalty depends on the integrity of the process followed by the state  So far as due process is concerned, twenty-four years of flawed proceedings are as good as no proceedings at all. the State of California may be about to execute an innocent man. Unfortunately, the Supreme Court refused to hear the case and that means that his conviction has been upheld. Now, Cooper is just weeks away from execution, he will be the first person in the state to be executed in the state since 2006 if Governor Jerry Brown does not grant him a stay.It is unprecedented to have five federal judges warn that an innocent man may be executed. Frankly, in a case like this that should be all that is needed for a new trial, at the very least.The death penalty is controversial in this country. It is one of those things that even liberals are split on. But whether you are pro- or anti-capital punishment I think we can all agree that if there is the slightest chance that someone may be innocent, the state should not be killing them. And I am saying this to you as a person whose father was violently murdered. Governor Jerry Brown needs to halt this execution. If this man is put to death when there is so much evidence pointing to his innocence, our entire judicial system will be invalidated.Featured image via Save Innocents",1,en

"Turkey links U.S. judge in sanctions case to wanted cleric. ANKARA (Reuters) - President Tayyip Erdogan s spokesman said on Wednesday the U.S. judge hearing the trial of an executive at Turkey s state-owned Halkbank had taken part in events organized by a cleric Ankara blames for last year s failed military coup.  The issue has gone beyond a legal case, it has become a political case,  spokesman Ibrahim Kalin said in reference to the New York trial of a deputy general manager at the bank, who is charged with helping Iran evade U.S. sanctions.  The executive has pleaded not guilty and Halkbank says it has abided by Turkish and international law.  Erdogan s government has portrayed the case as a  plot against Turkey  by the network of U.S.-based cleric Fethullah Gulen, who it alleges engineered last year s coup attempt.   It is known that the judge has participated in events upon Gulen s invitation,  Kalin told a news conference, without giving details. Turkish newspapers have said Judge Richard Berman attended a legal symposium in Istanbul in 2014 organized by Gulen supporters. Berman could not be reached for comment. At the first hearing in the case he said he was one of five U.S. legal experts who spoke at the symposium and moderated a panel discussion on independent and effective judiciary. In response to previous criticism from Turkey, the United States has said its judicial processes are independent.  Already strained ties between NATO allies Ankara and Washington have deteriorated further over the court case, in which Turkish-Iranian gold trader Reza Zarrab, who is cooperating with U.S. prosecutors, has detailed a scheme to evade U.S. sanctions. Zarrab has implicated top Turkish politicians, including Erdogan. Zarrab said on Thursday that when Erdogan was prime minister he had authorized a transaction to help Iran evade U.S. sanctions. Although he has not yet responded to the courtroom claims, Erdogan has dismissed the case as a politically motivated attempt, led by Gulen, to bring down the Turkish government.  We will continue watching it within the framework of the law, but the public is seeing how this is trying to be used as an instrument of blackmail,  Kalin said.  We have not done anything in violation of international laws, we carried out our activities transparently,  Kalin said. Turkey has repeatedly requested Gulen s extradition, but U.S. officials have said the courts require sufficient evidence before they can extradite the elderly cleric, who has denied any involvement in the coup. Gulen has lived in self-imposed exile in Pennsylvania since 1999. ",0,en

" McCain Opens Up A Can Of Whoop A** On Trump For Threatening North Korea With Nuclear War. Sen. John McCain is fed up with Donald Trump and his big mouth. Following Trump s ill-advised decision to challenge North Korea with  fire and fury,  the Arizona Republican let him know it in no uncertain terms.Speaking about Trump s latest bluster and bravado regarding nuclear war, McCain told an Arizona radio station that he  takes exception to the president s words because you got to be sure you can do what you say you re going to do.  He then added that he doesn t even know what the hell Trump is talking about anymore. I don t know what he s saying and I ve long ago given up trying to interpret what he says,  McCain said. That kind of rhetoric, I m not sure how it helps. McCain explained that Trump and his ego are going to spark a  serious confrontation  with North Korea. He advised Trump to familiarize himself with former President Teddy Roosevelt s  big stick  policy. In other words, the old walk softly but carry a big stick, Teddy Roosevelt s saying, which I think is something that should ve applied because all it s going to do is bring us closer to a serious confrontation,  McCain warned.  I think this is very, very, very serious. NEW: Sen.

"WATCH What Happens To Freedom When A Nation Puts Political Correctness Before Its Citizens [VIDEO]. This video should open the eyes of every American who doesn t understand the seriousness of putting political correctness before our freedoms, and the safety and security of our nation.Hillary has a track record of always putting her best interests first. She won t admit to the consequences of not properly vetting refugees who come from Muslim majority nations who hate us. For Hillary, it s all about the votes and she s zeroed in on the Muslim-American community as a much needed voting block if she is to win this election. One of Hilary s main criticisms of Donald Trump is that he s a  xenophobe  or  racist  for insisting we properly vet refugees before they enter our country. She s twisted Trump s desire to protect Americans from a violent and oppressive ideology into a politically correct argument. A President of The United States is tasked with protecting and defending the safety and security of its citizens. There is no requirement for a President to give permission to any foreigner who wishes to enter to our country, simply because they don t want to be called names. A strong leader, like Donald J. Trump is able to ignore the PC hit squad, and focus instead on the best interests of the people he has promised to represent. That is exactly why Trump s rallies are jam packed with thousand of passionate supporters, while Hillary can barely fill a high school gym with a disinterested group of committed Democrats. Americans are passionate about protecting our nation. We want a Presidents who puts American citizens first, not one who puts their own political ambitions first. Hillary supporters need to watch this video to see what happens to a nation that is ruled by people who put its citizens dead last Pun intended.",1,en

"French police find more explosives after raid near Paris. PARIS (Reuters) - French police unearthed a second stash of explosive materials near Paris on Thursday after a similar find in a nearby suburb on Wednesday, a justice official said as three suspects were questioned by anti-terrorism investigators. Thursday s swoop was carried out at a garage rented by one of the three detained in the wake of Wednesday s raid on an apartment in Villejuif, on the southern edge of the French capital, the source said. Materials used to produce TATP, an explosive often used by suicide bombers, were found at the flat after a plumber phoned  police to report suspect activity there, Interior Minister Gerard Collomb said.  Two people in their 30s and 40s were arrested in the immediate wake of Wednesday s raid, said Collomb, who added that the suspects were being questioned on suspicion of terrorist activity despite talking of a bank heist. A third man was arrested overnight, a source said.  Those under investigation spoke of wanting to blow up a bank with the TATP but they way we see it is they have links with terrorism, and this is the channel of investigation,  Collomb told public radio station franceinfo. That line of inquiry was prompted by information found in telephone communications after the raid, he added. The minister spoke before developments later in the day in which police found explosive materials at a garage in Thiais, southeast of Paris.  More than 230 people have been killed by Islamist-inspired attackers in the past three years in France, which along with the United States and other countries are bombing Islamic State bases in Iraq and Syria. TATP, an unstable explosive, has been used by militants in several attacks in western Europe in recent years, including Manchester in May, Brussels in 2016 and Paris in 2015. ",0,en

"WATCH: SENATOR JOHN MCCAIN Tells TMZ Sports Reporter He’s Okay With NFL Players Disrespecting Our Flag. John McCain really doesn t care what topic reporters ask him about, he only cares how President Trump feels about it, so he can take an opposing view.  If President Trump agrees with a social or political issue, McCain disagrees with it. If Trump disagrees, McCain thinks it s a great idea.The cantankerous John McCain has become so predictable, it s almost laughable to hear his opinions anymore.  He s become an embarrassment to the Republican Party but refuses to give up the R behind his name to save the party of the humiliation of his antics.McCain s latest embarrassing interview happened today when TMZ caught up with him to ask him his thoughts on the NFL players taking a knee in a show of disrespect for our flag, as a way to support the anti-cop Black Lives Matter movement.  Instead of standing up our flag, or for his fellow veterans and the country he once fought so valiantly for, McCain took the cowardly way out and made a statement supporting the NFL player s right to disrespect our flag. Not surprisingly, McCain s remarks stood in contrast to strong admonition President Trump had for the disrespectful athletes in the NFL.Watch:",1,en

"After air strike, Israeli minister warns against arms shipments to Hezbollah. JERUSALEM (Reuters) - A senior Israeli minister on Thursday declined to comment on reports that Israeli aircraft had struck a target in Syria the night before but repeated a threat to hit arms shipments to Lebanese Hezbollah guerrillas. The air strike targeted a factory south of the Syrian city of Homs on Wednesday night and the Syrian army responded by firing a surface-to-air missile at the aircraft, a commander in a military alliance fighting in support of Damascus said. An Israeli military spokeswoman declined to comment, but Israel s Channel 10 said the aircraft were not hit and returned safely to base.  I can t, of course, relate to reports about the Israel Defence Forces  attack in Syria, but regardless, Israel s position is clear: Smuggling arms to Hezbollah is a red line in our eyes,  Intelligence Minister Israel Katz told Army Radio. Syria s Foreign Ministry called on the United Nations Security Council to condemn Israel s attack, state-run SANA news agency reported. The Foreign Ministry asked the Security Council to take  strict and immediate  measures to stop such Israeli attacks, it said, adding that the strike hit a copper factory in the industrial town of Hisya, 35 km (21 miles) south of Homs and 112 km (70 miles) north of Damascus. The statement did not give details of any casualties. The Syrian Observatory for Human Rights, a Britain-based organization that reports on the war, said the air strike had targeted a military installation.  Israel has acted in the past and it will act in the future to prevent arms smuggling to Hezbollah according to intelligence information that we will have,  said Katz, who is a member of Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu s inner circle of ministers. He said Israel s  red line  was  against arms smuggling (and) also against Iran s consolidation in Syria  and that it was  prepared to act to deter against our responses.   I think the other side also understands this clearly and actions that took place in the past for which we did take responsibility, were actions that were according to these lines, these red lines,  Katz added. The Israeli air force says it has struck arms convoys of the Syrian military and its Lebanese ally, the Iran-backed Hezbollah, nearly 100 times in recent years. Israeli officials have expressed alarm at Iranian influence in Syria, where Iran-backed groups have played a critical role fighting in support of President Bashar al-Assad during the conflict that erupted in 2011. Iran s military chief, General Mohammad Baqeri, warned Israel against breaching Syrian airspace and territory during a visit to Damascus last month. Tensions between Israel and Hezbollah, which last fought a major conflict in 2006, have escalated this year. Each side has warned it will unleash devastating firepower in the event of a full-scale war. ",0,en

"Among Trump associates, concern and frustration over Donald Jr. crisis. WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Fresh off one foreign trip and preparing for another, Donald Trump was enjoying a period of relative calm - until the White House was rocked by a fresh controversy over contacts between the president’s campaign and Russia. For Trump, who has been swept up all year in crises of his own making, this time the target was his eldest son, Donald Trump Jr., whose meeting with a Russian lawyer last year led to accusations that the president’s son entertained working with Russians to spread negative information about Democrat Hillary Clinton.  Among Trump’s wide-ranging group of outside advisers and former campaign officials, Donald Jr.’s meeting with the lawyer on the expectation of gaining access to negative information on Clinton was seen as problematic, a demonstration of the son’s political inexperience, but not illegal. “You can’t shrug this off even though you know he’s very likely going to be okay,” said an outside Trump adviser, who asked to remain unidentified. “This is the president’s namesake and you have to circle the wagons in defense of the president’s son.” “There’s no question in my mind that every person in the White House has some level of concern about this. Otherwise it’s malpractice,” the adviser said. Inside the White House, the mood was one of heavy acceptance that another political problem had emerged but also of caution as to its significance for a wider probe into Russia’s meddling in the election and whether there was collusion with the Trump campaign. Benumbed by previous crises from the firing of then-FBI Director James Comey to the appointment of a special prosecutor, White House officials showed no signs of panic and said they were trying to advance the president’s agenda. The new incident erupted as Trump seemingly enjoyed a rare moment of calm. His trip to Warsaw and Hamburg last week went fairly smoothly, although critics accused him of not being tough enough in his meeting with Russian President Vladimir Putin. On Wednesday, he is to depart to Paris for talks with French President Emmanuel Macron and to participate in flag-waving Bastille Day ceremonies. Trump himself was described by the White House as frustrated by yet another distraction involving the Russia investigation. “He knows that he didn’t do anything and he really wants to focus on the good things that are happening and the things he was elected to do, and he doesn’t like it when things get in the way,” a senior White House official said. The president offered a restrained reaction, not resorting to Twitter to launch a tirade against his critics, but issuing a brief statement praising his “high-quality person” who showed “transparency” by releasing the email chain with the lawyer on Tuesday.  There was a sense among former campaign advisers that Donald Trump Jr. had shown his political naivete by agreeing to the meeting. They noted that it took place at a time when Trump had a barebones staff and that his family members, initially reluctant to getting involved in his campaign, were searching to carve out space for themselves. “Besides proving that he was gullible and he got snookered, it’s still not a smoking gun,” said one former campaign adviser. Among even Republicans, there was dismay at the turn of events. Conservative author Quin Hillyer wrote in a blog post that Trump should step down for cozying up to Russia. (The blog link is here)  “The American people absolutely cannot trust Trump’s objectivity about Russian intentions and Russian actions,” Hillyer wrote. “This is an utterly untenable situation. For the good of the country, Trump must lance the boil, and resign.” The outside Trump adviser said the Trump Jr. case “unfortunately supports the narrative” advanced by Trump’s Democratic opponents and propagated by what Trump world feels is a left-leaning news media. “Donald Jr. is the nicest of nice guys, genuinely authentic,” the adviser said. “A lot of us are disappointed that if it had to be somebody, why did it have to be Don Jr.?” ",0,en

" Donald Trump Gets Schlonged By His Own Ghost Writer, Who Refuses To Vote For Him (AUDIO). When Donald Trump  wrote  a book in 2000, he didn t think it would come back to bite him on the ass.But that book, and the man who actually wrote it, have surfaced to draw a picture of a Donald Trump who is doing the total opposite of what he said sixteen years ago.Dave Shiflett did the heavy lifting on Trump s book  The America We Deserve,  and during an appearance on Fox News Radio with Alan Colmes, the ghost writer slammed the Republican presidential wannabe for being a total asshole who has completely contradicted himself in an attempt to become the GOP nominee. I used to think it was my first work of fiction,  Shiflett said of the book before remarking that it s hard to know where Trump stands on anything because he s a thematic person.Shiflett went on to describe how Trump used to hold very progressive views such as supporting single-payer healthcare and tax increases on the wealthy. He also mentioned how Trump ironically used to criticize Pat Buchanan for saying  too many outrageous and controversial things  to be considered a serious candidate for the presidency. In short, Trump once believed that being outrageous and controversial automatically disqualifies someone from being commander-in-chief, which means he would be disqualified himself since he has clearly adopted Pat Buchanan s style.And despite being Trump s ghost writer, there is no way in hell that Shiflett is voting for him.In the beginning of his campaign, Trump attacked Senator John McCain for being a POW during the Vietnam War, a war that Trump avoided by dodging the draft. McCain was captured after being shot down by enemy forces and he was then brutally tortured to the point where he can no longer lift his arms over his head. Shiflett has been angry about Trump s treatment of McCain ever since, and for good reason. I ll tell you what really bugs me about him, where it really ripped it with me and Trump was the stuff he said about McCain. McCain suffered severely, and I had a son who did two tours in Middle East during the last war and we had kids from here who went over there and some of them got hurt. They ain t gonna be the same. Here s the audio via Buzzfeed:Sounds like Trump s criticism of McCain was the last straw for Shiflett, as it probably was for many Americans. The fact is that John McCain is a war hero who sacrificed for his country, something that Donald Trump refused to do when he had the same opportunity to fight during the war. Instead, Trump chose to dodge the draft through multiple deferments, including a questionable medical deferment.Also, the fact that Donald Trump is using the Pat Buchanan playbook in his run for president is scary, especially since it appears to actually be working this time around 24 years after Americans rejected it when Buchanan sought the Republican nomination in 1992. This just shows how racist and sexist the Republican Party has become over the last two and a half decades.Featured Image: YouTube",1,en

"House Republicans ready legal fight against Obama's Guantanamo plan. WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Republicans in the House of Representatives are preparing legal action in case President Barack Obama tries to transfer detainees at the military prison at Guantanamo Bay to the United States, House Speaker Paul Ryan said on Wednesday. Ryan told reporters it would be against the law for Obama to bring detainees from the prison in Cuba to the United States, because it would violate a ban on such transfers passed by Congress in 2015. He was speaking a day after the president, seeking to make good on a pledge he made in 2008 before he was first elected to the White House, launched a final push to persuade Congress to close the military prison for foreign terrorism suspects. The Pentagon-authored plan proposes 13 potential sites on U.S. soil to hold some 30 to 60 detainees in maximum-security prisons. Obama is also considering taking executive action to close Guantanamo, situated at a U.S. naval station in southeast Cuba, if Congress does not drop its opposition. “Our law is really clear,” Ryan told reporters after a meeting of House Republicans. “These detainees cannot come to American soil.”  “We are making legal preparations if the president tries to break the law,” Ryan said. “And what boggles my mind is that the president is contemplating directing the military to knowingly break the law.”  The speaker said that Obama is trying to extend the president’s executive authority beyond its limits of the U.S. Constitution. Ryan added that not only Republicans but also many in Obama’s own Democratic Party oppose detainee transfers to U.S. soil. Democrats accused House Republicans of wasting taxpayer dollars on litigation. In recent years the House Republican majority has spent nearly $3 million in this way, said Drew Hammill, a spokesman for House Democratic Leader Nancy Pelosi. House Republicans have spent $189,498 since November 2014 on litigation challenging the administration’s Obamacare healthcare program, and recently agreed to spend up to $150,000 on legal advice on the possible Guantanamo litigation, Pelosi’s office said. A spokesman for Ryan, Brendan Buck, defended the spending, saying “we wouldn’t have to spend so much money if the president wasn’t overreaching.” Pelosi’s office said that under former House Speaker John Boehner, House Republicans spent $2.5 million defending a law that denied federal benefits to same-sex couples, before the language was struck down by the Supreme Court.

"Kenya chief justice says police 'enhanced' security after shooting. NAIROBI (Reuters) - Kenya s chief justice said the national police chief had  enhanced  the security of Supreme Court judges after one of their bodyguards was shot, denying a Reuters report that a request for extra security had been turned down.  The judges  safety was thrust into focus last week after the shooting, which occurred on Tuesday evening. The next day, five out of seven judges failed to come to court to issue a judgment on an election petition seeking to delay the next day s presidential poll, sparking widespread speculation of intimidation. A senior judicial source told Reuters earlier this week that after the shooting the judges, who are normally allocated one bodyguard, had requested another vehicle, known as a  chaser car , to follow or go ahead of them as they moved around the country. The source, who was not available to speak on Thursday, said this request was turned down.  The source also said the judges were upset at the government s characterisation of the shooting as a crime rather than an attempt to intimidate judges who had recently annulled the August election victory of President Uhuru Kenyatta. The statement, issued by Chief Justice David Maraga s office late on Wednesday, said the story was wrong.  To the contrary, the Inspector General of Police has in fact enhanced the security of Supreme Court judges,  it said.  It did not give further details.  Interior Ministry spokesman Mwenda Njoka said Deputy Chief Justice Philomena Mwilu had been allocated six police to guard her after the shooting of her bodyguard, who is in hospital in stable condition. He declined to comment on whether any other judges had requested extra security, but noted that both the interior minister and chief of police had promised they could have whatever they requested.  He said he was not able to give details of the extra security provided because  that in itself would be a breach of security protocols .  Kenyatta won the repeat presidential poll on Oct. 26 with 98 percent of the vote after opposition leader Raila Odinga withdrew from the race, saying it would not be fair.  The repeat election was ordered by the Supreme Court after it nullified the results of a poll on Aug. 8 due to procedural irregularities. The election board said Kenyatta won that election by 1.4 million votes. ",0,en

They were instructed to begin referring to the student as a boy and call her by a boy s name.School administrators reportedly gave staff a handout to refer to when addressing questions from other students. It caused confusion,  Kirksey told Fox26.  I don t think we should be talking to other people s children who are under the age of 18 about being transgender.

One day, she wanted to be a girl, the next day she wanted to be a boy,  Kirksey said.  The other kids are confused as well, calling her a boy and she would start screaming,  I m not a boy!

"MEDIA ATTACKS TAYLOR SWIFT Over Refusal To Criticize President-Elect Trump. Tom Barnes mocks Taylor Swift in his latest article, as he writes:  One Instagram is the only evidence we have that Nashville elite Taylor Swift even knew there was an election taking place in 2016. Today is the day,  she wrote on Election Day.  Go out and VOTE. Today is the day. Go out and VOTE  A photo posted by Taylor Swift (@taylorswift) on Nov 8, 2016 at 8:01am PSTSo thirsty was the public for hints of Swift s political affiliations, that even an innocent picture of a voting line, stirred up a frenzy.  Who is Taylor Swift voting for?  skyrocketed in search queries, proving at the end of the cycle to have been one of the most popular search terms of the entire election.Fans read deeply into the symbolism of Swift s outfit and posture. Others took it as an opportunity to try to bait her into the political arena, pointing out her hypocrisy of having once styled herself as an outspoken feminist, only to back down at this most crucial moment. Admittedly some of those commentators had a point. It s difficult to look away from the fact that one of the most staunchly anti-woman candidates gallivanted into Washington followed by scores sexual assault accusations in tow, and Swift just watched.It is wrong to exploit feminism in order to sell records but then stand idly by as a misogynist ravages the country. Just FYI  Casey Mink (@Casey_Mink) November 8, 2016Swift remains to this day one of the only major A-list celebrities who has not weighed in on the election. Lady Gaga comforted fans distraught by Trump s successful attempts to reduce rape culture to  locker talk.  Kesha, Madonna, Beyonc , Nicki Minaj and Adele all connected with their fan bases to explain why Hillary Clinton offered the best way forward. Katy Perry literally did not stop singing and speaking for Clinton for the entirety of 2016. In a Time op-ed alongside a handful of clickier stunts, Swift bestie Lena Dunham said her support for Clinton was about far more than just  anatomy  or  girl power  Scores of artists have outright shamed the presidential inauguration committee for even asking to perform.Given her election silence, Swift has undoubtedly been approached, but her team has yet to offer a comment.A carefully chosen word of warning about the effect a successful Trump bid on normalizing misogyny or discrimination would have made for a natural extension of Swift s past desires to increase the level of public discourse around feminism. One could say the election is just another  narrative  she  never asked to be a part of,  and they would be correct. But if you re Swift, why not speak up? For every time she made sure that the word  feminism  was as close to her name in headlines, it feels odd she would pass on a lay-up as easy as helping clarify what  locker room talk  actually means. A close look at the fans she needs to please helps explain the silence. She caters to a white audience that used to be country and then crossed over into pop,  Ani Johnson, associate professor of Music Business at Berklee College of Music and international lecturer and consultant in music licensing, marketing and strategic startups, said in an email.  She has to  stay sweet,   stay demure    the perfect picture of the blond, blue-eyed, true blue, young American girl. She can t afford to speak up and lose sales from her red state, Republican base. It s clear to Johnson what that base wants:  a pretty girl who sings about love and has  effectively  nothing in her head.   Music.MicMeryl Streep s acceptance speech at the Golden Globes Award ceremony really backfired on her when conservatives in social media, and even some on the Left, were taken aback by her petulant attack on our President-elect Donald Trump.  Streep really gave her viewers an opportunity to see her mean, bully streak when she stood on the stage, and without any credible evidence to back it up, accused Trump of being a racist and demeaning a disabled reporter. Both of those claims are false, but who the hell needs facts when you re an Academy Award winning actress and can PRETEND they re true?The Left s obsession didn t start with Meryl Streep.

She also promised to leave the country if Trump was elected. Unfortunately, she s still here. Her promise to leave the country was as honest as her manufactured claims about Donald Trump being a misogynist.Donald Trump hit back when Lena Dunham (along with a long list of  celebrities ) said she d leave the US if Trump won the election:Gigi Hadid can be seen frequently hanging out with Taylor Swift on Instagram and in the tabloids.

"EVERY U.S. CITIZEN TAKEN HOSTAGE IN IRAN To Be Awarded Millions…With A Catch…Iran’s Not Paying…YOU Are!. Just another slap in the face to US citizens. Our government arranges massive payments to hostages taken by the terrorist nation of Iran, as they walk away unscathed .A fund of over $1 billion has been created for the U.S. embassy personnel taken hostage by Iran after the 1979 Islamic Revolution, but it is the U.S. taxpayer, not Iran, who will be paying for it.The new fund, known as the  United States Victims of State Sponsors of Terrorism Fund,  was an addition to the omnibus bill put forward by Congress and signed into law by President Barack Obama Dec. 28. As much as $4.4 million could go to each of the 52 Americans held by Iran, with another $600,000 going to each spouse and child of the victims. The provision authorizes $1.025 billion from the Department of the Treasury to be used to pay for the new fund. Additionally, the legislation includes a 25 percent cap on any attorney s fees, which could lead to as much as $250 million total going to lawyers of the various victims involved.The victims were taken hostage during Iran s Islamic Revolution led by former Supreme Leader Ayatollah Khomeini. Hundreds of student protesters stormed the U.S. embassy in Tehran taking 52 U.S. personnel hostage for 444 days. Several months after the takeover, former President Jimmy Carter authorized Operation Eagle Claw, a rescue attempt by U.S. special operations forces which would later fail. The hostages would eventually be released after a lengthy negotiation process the day of President Ronald Reagan s inauguration in January, 1981. Victims of the embassy attack have been seeking compensation for their captivity for some time, but have been prevented from taking legal action against Iran. The 1981 Algiers Accords, the agreement which secured the release of the hostages, had a provision barring the victims from suing the Iranian government.  Iran is not paying the money, but it s as close as you can get,  says Thomas Lankford, an attorney for one of the victims, speaking to The Washington Post. Lankford refers to a clause in the new law which mandates that any money collected from the BNP Paribas scandal will be used for the new fund and the various 9/11 victim funds. The U.S. levied a fine of $9 billion on the French bank in June 2014 for its evasion of sanctions against countries like Iran, Cuba and North Korea.The staggering amount of compensation being paid to the victims is remarkably higher than the $262,000 suggested by the George W. Bush administration in 2003.  Some may be surprised that a fiscally conservative Republican-controlled Congress would authorize payments of more than $250 million from the U.S. Treasury to private attorneys, even on behalf of victims of terrorism deserving compensation,  writes attorney John Bellinger in the Lawfare blog.

"WOW! Donna Brazile Was Warned To Protect Herself After Seth Rich Murder…When Brazile Asked Hillary To Use Some of Her Millions To Help Find Rich’s Murderer…Hillary Abruptly Ended Phone Call. Is former DNC Chair Donna Brazile attempting to tie Hillary to the murder of DNC staffer Seth Rich in her new book  Hacks ? What does Brazile know? Is she in danger if she says too much? Is Brazile offering just enough information, so that authorities are pressured into looking into a connection with Hillary and Seth Rich s murder?  From her book  Hacks :I felt some responsibility for Seth Rich s death. I didn t bring him into the DNC, but I helped keep him there working on voting rights. With all I knew now about the Russians  hacking, I could not help but wonder if they had played some part in his unsolved murder. Besides that, racial tensions were high that summer and I worried that he was murdered for being white on the wrong side of town. [My friend] Elaine expressed her doubts about that, and I heard her. The FBI said that they did not see any Russian fingerprints there.Daily Caller   Brazile repeatedly returns to the subject of being haunted by Rich s murder, even though other Democrats have pounced on anyone who suggested that the murder was anything other than a robbery gone wrong. The DNC data staffer was killed days before Wikileaks began publishing its emails, and his valuables were not taken.100 Percent Fed Up   The private investigator, Rod Wheeler, who was hired by the Rich family to get to the bottom of the murder of their son, DNC staffer Seth Rich, offered startling information on the Rich murder case when he appeared on the Sean Hannity show on May 15, 2017.  Wheeler spoke about the mystery of why they can t locate the computer Rich used. They went on to discuss clues in the case that point to collusion between the DC police and the DNC. The most shocking information comes at the 4:20 mark when Wheeler says that a  high ranking official at the DNC  wanted to know why he was snooping around.Rod Wheeler:  Here s one other thing that is going to be startling I m just gonna say this right now. I reached out to the police department way back in March when the family first hired me right..to get involved. I didn t hear anything from the police department for 2-3 days.Guess what I learned yesterday from the family of Seth Rich? The police department did not call me back because someone, a high ranking official at the DNC check this out a high ranking official at the DNC when I called the police department, they got that information and called the Rich family wanting to know, why was I snooping around? Shorty after WND wrote a story that outed Donna Brazile as the  high ranking DNC representative who allegedly called the police to ask why a private investigator was  snooping  into Rich s death, Twitter SUSPENDED WND s account!Here s the title and an excerpt from the WND article:BOMBSHELL: DONNA BRAZILE WARNED OFF PRIVATE EYE ON SETH RICH MURDEREx-DNC chairwoman reportedly asked cops why investigator is  snooping  into mysterious case Alicia Powe and Liz Crokin wrote the story that was also posted to and deleted from the social media platform by Twitter: Former Democratic National Committee interim chairwoman Donna Brazile is the high-ranking DNC representative who allegedly called police and the family of murdered DNC staffer Seth Rich and demanded to know why a private investigator was  snooping  into Rich s death, the private eye revealed to WND Monday. The high-ranking DNC official that called the police after I inquired about Rich s case was Donna Brazile,  veteran homicide detective Rod Wheeler told WND.  Why shouldn t I reveal who it was? Brazile, who was also a CNN contributor and a Hillary for America donor at the time, was caught providing Democratic Party nominee Hillary Clinton with questions that would later be asked of Clinton at a televised CNN town hall. In an interview with Fox News before the election, Brazile denied leaking the questions to Clinton. But in a March 17, 2017, column for Time magazine, she finally admitted doing so, saying it was a  mistake I will forever regret. According to WND, their Twitter account was suspended because of this Seth Rich investigation bombshell.Daily Caller   But Brazile says she had a  spook,  with connections to the intelligence community, who told her after the killing that she needed protection for herself, including cameras, alarms and backup power at her house, and that she heeded his advice.I knew the campaign had over $3 million set aside in a legal fund. Could she help me get this lawsuit started? And don t forget the murder of Seth Rich, I told her. Did she want to contribute to Seth s reward fund? We still hadn t found the person responsible for the tragic murder of this bright young DNC staffer. You re right, she said. We re going to get to that. But she really had to go. She had made the call and checked it off her list, and I accepted after we said our goodbyes that I might never hear from her again.",1,en

"[VIDEO] HUNDREDS OF MORMON FUNDAMENTALISTS SURROUND Mother Who Escaped Cult Community To Prevent Her From Extracting Her Children. Evil hiding under the banner of  religion  in our own backyard A 32-year-old woman was harassed and intimidated last week when she tried to pick up her four children from the fundamentalist Mormon sect she bravely left to escape an abusive husband.Sabrina Broadbent Tetzner, 32, fled the sect headed by convicted rapist Warren Jeffs eight years ago and finally gained full custody of her children (ages 8 to 13) last week.But when she tried to pick up her children from the Colorado City, Utah community where they have been living, she was physically stopped by hundreds of cult members hell bent on keeping the kids. Lots of members from the community started showing up. They surrounded her vehicle, the home, fences and the yard. They were kicking the van. They even tried to put a cow and chickens into her vehicle,  ex-cult member Flora Jessop, who helped Tetzner through her legal battle, told KSL.Cell phone footage shows swarms of polygamists surrounding Tetzner s van, the women dressed in conservative floor-length dresses in varying pastel colors. A Mohave County judge ordered the sect to turn over the children at 5pm Thursday, but Tetzner says that when she got to the compound at the arranged time her kids were nowhere to be seen. FOX 10 News | fox10phoenix.comIt was only at midnight that they returned, and were quickly shepherded into their aunt Samantha Holm s house where several dozen fundamentalists kept them from seeing her mother.Tetzner spent the night in her van, fearing the vehicle would be torn apart if she left it unattended. When even about 600 cult members surrounded her vehicle in the morning, and kept her from reaching the home where her children were staying, Tetzner called police to intervene on her children s behalf. Sheriff s deputies had to take out a search warrant to pry the children from the house and into their mother s waiting arms.Allegedly, the children were not so happy to leave, since cult members had scared them into believing their mother was taking them to hell. Deputies escorted Tetzner and her children all the way back to their home in northern Utah, and reportedly FLDS members tailed them the whole way there.Since leaving the sect, she has remarried a man named Chase Tetzner and the two appear to have a toddler son together. A photo posted to her Facebook in August 2012, shows her in a half-white, half-camouflage wedding dress.Defenders of Children, a non-profit group that has been aiding Tetzner through her custody battle, said they fear for her safety and are raising money to pay for a security system and new clothes for the woman s children. Tetzner left the FLDS church eight years ago, about a year after the cult s leader Warren Jeffs was arrested for organizing marriages between men in his cult and underage girls. He is currently serving a life sentence in prison, but continues to head the church from behind bars.Custodial interference charges are pending against Samantha Holm, the aunt who initially wouldn t hand over Tetzner s children.Via: UK Daily Mail",1,en

No enemy prisoner should have access to Federal courts a noncitizen, enemy combatant terrorist to bring a lawsuit against those fighting on our behalf. No judge should have the ability to make a decision that has been historically reserved to the military. That does not make us safer.

"BOOM! BRONCOS PLAYER Has Message For Fellow NFL Players Disrespecting Our Flag: “We Live In The Greatest Country On Earth”…If You Don’t Like It Here…”Why Do You Stay?”. He clarified that protesting in the United States is a right, but he also challenged the players taking a knee: If there s somewhere better, why don t you leave?Broncos defensive end Derek Wolfe explained Sunday why he stands for the national anthem, referencing the troops and the ideal vision of America. Wolfe, who is white, did not reference whether he agrees with the basis of the protest that gained steam Sunday following President Trump s condemnation: to object to the treatment of minorities in the United States.Entering Sunday, only one white player, Seth DeValve of Cleveland, had joined the movement. I stand because I respect the men who died in real battles so I have the freedom to battle on the field,  Wolfe, 27, told ESPN in a statement.  Paying tribute to the men and women who have given their lives for our freedom is why I stand. But everyone these days likes to find a reason to protest and that s their right. It s America and you are free to speak your mind. I just feel it s disrespectful to the ones who sacrificed their lives and it s the wrong platform. But like I said to each their own it s AMERICA! The greatest country in the world and if you don t think we are the greatest country in the world and you reside here, then why do you stay? A lot worse places in the world to call home. Proud to be an American. Several of his Broncos teammates took a kneel Sunday, days after Trump urged owners to kick the  son of a bitch  who protests off the team.

" Democrats Chant Warning To GOP As Trumpcare Passes: Na Na Na Na, Hey Hey Hey, Goodbye! (VIDEO). Alleged president Donald Trump is throwing a party for House Republicans after passing the worst healthcare plan imaginable to replace Obamacare while sticking a knife in the back of the middle class. Republicans had eight years to come up with a viable alternative, but instead, the ACHA will raise pregnancy costs by 425 percent, and the top two percent will be gifted with a trillion dollar tax cut and that will be paid for by the bottom 40 percent. Fiscally conservative Republicans don t seem to care what Trumpcare will cost the taxpayers. They refused to wait for the CBO scores to find out.Twenty Republicans in total broke with their party and voted against the bill which will strip health care from 24 million Americans.Democrats had a message for House Republicans who voted to let this travesty of a health care plan pass.

"Democrats blast Trump's pick for Education Secretary.  (Corrects in 6th paragraph to clarify rules) By Lisa Lambert WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Democrats sliced holes in billionaire Betsy DeVos’ credentials to be the next U.S. Education Secretary at a confirmation hearing on Tuesday, raising doubts whether President-elect Donald Trump’s pick will win approval in the full Senate. The nomination of DeVos to head an agency that sets policy for younger children and universities and also administers a college financial aid program of $1 trillion has outraged Democrats who believe the Michigan Republican wants to dismantle public education.  Teachers unions, a major constituency for the party, roundly oppose DeVos, a philanthropist and investor. “Do you think if you were not a multi-billionaire, if your family had not made hundreds of millions of dollars in contributions to the Republican party, that you would be sitting here today?” asked Independent Bernie Sanders of Vermont, who recently ran to be the Democrats’ presidential nominee.  Democratic Senators have made their opposition clear in recent days in letters, speeches and most notably at the hearing.  Next Tuesday, the Education Committee will likely approve sending her name to the full chamber when it votes in an executive session next Tuesday. Then, Democrats could attempt to block the nomination on the Senate floor. Because nominations other than those for the Supreme Court only require a simple majority vote, they will not be able to use a filibuster and would have to convince Republicans to join them in voting against the nomination. Former Senator Joe Lieberman, Democrats’ candidate for vice president in 2000, gave DeVos a laudatory introduction at the hearing, but other party members were wide-ranging in their  criticism. Minnesota’s Al Franken expressed surprise DeVos was unfamiliar with a hot education debate over measuring student achievement by proficiency or by growth. Connecticut’s Chris Murphy was dismayed when DeVos did not condemn guns in schools.  Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts, an advocate of tough financial regulation, asked whether DeVos or her children had attended public schools, borrowed student loans or received federal financial help known as Pell grants. “You have no experience with financial aid,” Warren summed up when DeVos answered “no.” Many were dismayed DeVos would not pledge to carry out rules on sexual assault, for-profit colleges and fair access for students with disabilities, only saying she would review the policies.  Generally, Democrats pressed on how DeVos will manage her investments and companies in the education sector, including an on-line charter school, while serving as the most powerful public figure in the area.  They also asked repeatedly if she intended to divert money to charter schools that operate independently of school districts and are frequently run by corporations and if she would undermine public schools. “I have major concerns with how you have spent your career and fortune fighting to privatize public education and gut investments in public schools,” said Washington’s Patty Murray, the committee’s senior Democrat. DeVos scrambled to reassure them she supports taxpayer-backed education. She also said she will work to give parents choices in the schools their children attend, treat all students equally and respect states’ decisions on education. The hearing, which was delayed from last week over missing financial disclosures, began at 5 p.m. (EST). Committee Chairman Lamar Alexander only allotted each member five minutes for questions. Democrats called foul, saying that because DeVos has not finished requisite ethics paperwork they are in the dark on issues and need more time. Alexander said the Office of Government Ethics will produce by Friday a letter outlining resolutions for her potential conflicts of interest. Committee Republicans universally backed DeVos, applauding her support of vouchers that families may use to pay for private education and of charter schools.  They praised her history with The Potter’s House, which provides “Christ-centered” education, and spoke of her dedication to literacy. ",0,en

"Factbox: Trump gives nod to Keystone XL oil pipeline. (Reuters) - U.S. President Donald Trump signed an executive order on Tuesday to move forward with construction of the Keystone XL oil pipeline, rolling back key Obama administration environmental actions in favor of expanding energy infrastructure.   In 2015, former President Barack Obama rejected the cross-border crude oil line, seven years after it was first proposed, citing environmental concerns and saying it would not make a meaningful long-term contribution to the U.S. economy. Below are key facts and issues surrounding the project. The 1,179-mile (1,900-km) Keystone XL pipeline would move 830,000 barrels per day of oil sands crude from Hardisty, Alberta, across the U.S. border to Steele City, Nebraska, where it would connect with a previously approved line. The $8 billion project is backed by TransCanada, Canada’s No. 2 pipeline company. It requires a Presidential Certificate to allow the line to cross the border, which TransCanada first applied for in 2008.  Refiners on the Gulf Coast want the line to supply them with  heavy oil and supplant uncertain supplies from Mexico and Venezuela. Canadian oil sands producers want to tap the world’s largest refining market for their oil and boost the price they get for their crude.  Environmentalists have made pipelines the proxy for their battle against exploiting Alberta’s oil sands, saying production techniques there emit massive amounts of carbon dioxide, one of the greenhouse gases blamed for global warming. Obama expressed skepticism of TransCanada’s claims about the number of jobs the project would create and said he was concerned that oil extraction from Canada’s oil sands was “extraordinarily dirty”. TransCanada called the rejection “a symbolic gesture” aimed at burnishing the Obama administration’s image on climate change leadership.  Opposition in Nebraska from environmentalists and some landowners concerned about oil spills had been among several major hurdles facing the Keystone XL project. The line's route through Nebraska has been the subject of a court case in the state over whether former Governor Dave Heineman was entitled to approve the route. (reut.rs/2jbx05V) A Nebraska Supreme Court decision in 2015 ruled in support of the pipeline, but a number of Nebraskan landowners filed suits against TransCanada alleging the project violated the state's constitution. (reut.rs/2kpZzh1) In a separate legal action, TransCanada has been suing the United States in U.S. federal court, seeking to reverse the Obama administration’s rejection of the pipeline.  ",0,en

" WATCH: Ex-Trump Campaign Manager’s First Appearance At CNN Job Is A DISASTER (VIDEO). The announcement that Donald Trump s problematic, misogynistic campaign manager Corey Lewandowski was fired from the Republican presidential candidate s campaign was a somewhat satisfying one, however it was soon replaced with bewilderment when it was announced that CNN had picked Lewandowski up.Mere days of being thrown out of the Trump campaign, CNN offered Lewandowski a job where he is rumored to be paid as much as $500,000 as a political commentator for the network. The network s move raised eyebrows   especially considering the fact that Lewandowski as actually forbidden to criticize Trump thanks to a handy contract Trump makes all of his minions sign.On Thursday evening, Lewandowski had his very first paid appearance   and it went exactly how you might expect it would   awful. On Erin Burnett s OutFront show, Lewandowski flat-out told viewers that he would not be criticizing Trump, yet in the same breath promising to  tell it like it is. Using the same vague response tactics he likely learned from Trump himself, Lewandowski dodged questions about his loyalty to Trump and said: I am a guy who calls balls and strikes, I am going to tell it like it is. I ll tell you exactly like it is, whether you like it or not. I m a straightforward person. That s not going to change. If something is wrong, I ll tell people it s wrong. If something is right, I m going to tell people it s right. Lewandowski s appearance was basically ten minutes of sucking up to The Donald, painting the picture that Trump is  the only person who is going to save this country, for my children and hopefully their children someday  even amongst claims that the Trump campaign was broke.You can see this train wreck unfold for yourself:Basically, Lewandowski is treating his new role as another opportunity to be a spokesperson for Trump, even after the campaign cut ties with him. This interview left viewers in shock   most notably New York University journalism professor Jay Rosen, who had the perfect reaction:TwitterCNN s decision to employ Lewandowski is baffling, considering that the network has recently spent a considerable amount of time pointing out Trump s lies. Giving paid airtime to someone who is obligated to say nice things about a horrible presidential candidate seems to really contradict the dent CNN was trying to make in the Trump campaign.Featured image is a screenshot",1,en

"Saudi businessman in debt dispute released from detention: sources. DUBAI (Reuters) - A Saudi Arabian businessman whose family s commercial empire is involved in a multi-billion dollar debt dispute has been released from detention in the kingdom s Eastern Province, according to sources familiar with the matter. Abdulaziz al-Sanea s release comes as the government steps up efforts to find a company to run a struggling 750-bed hospital owned by his family, a search that has turned the spotlight on the kingdom s effort to bring overseas investors into the healthcare sector. Al-Sanea was freed late last week after being detained in October for unpaid debts, related at least in part to the hospital, according to the sources. An arrest warrant, issued in October for his brother Mishal for the same reason, was also lifted, according to the same sources. At the same time, the authorities approved a plan intended to restart operations at Saad Specialist Hospital in the city of Khobar in Eastern Province, which has been closed in recent weeks after being unable to pay staff and contractors, according to the sources. A special committee, formed by the government to find solutions for the hospital s future, concluded that the facility should be operated under the guidance of the Ministry of Health for seven years, the sources said. The revenue would be deposited into the account of the court handling the liquidation of Saad Group, the family s company that owns the hospital, the sources added.   The Ministry of Justice did not respond to a Reuters request for comment. London-listed NMC Healthcare is among companies in talks with the government to take over the running of the hospital, one of the top cancer treatment facilities in the Gulf, Reuters reported on Thursday, citing sources familiar with the matter. Maan al-Sanea, the owner of Saad Group and the father of Abdulaziz and Mishal, is still in a civil detention center in Khobar, according to the sources. He was also detained by authorities in October for unpaid debts. Saad Group, which at its height employed about 12,000 staff and has interests in sectors spanning banking to healthcare, ran into difficulties in 2009 because of heavy debts, unleashing a series of long-running legal battles and a Saudi court-enforced liquidation of the company. Reemas Group, a financial consultancy hired by Saad Group, last month outlined a proposed settlement covering $4 billion in debt under a plan to repay part of the money owed to creditors. The legal action against the family is believed to be separate from a crackdown on corruption by Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman in which dozens of Saudi princes and businessmen are being held. The kingdom has released 23 of the 200-or-so powerful individuals detained since November on corruption charges after they reached deals with the government, Okaz newspaper reported on Tuesday.

"Senator McConnell says ending U.S. debt ceiling would be challenging. WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Senate Republican leader Mitch McConnell voiced doubt on Tuesday that the U.S. debt ceiling would be eliminated permanently, an idea floated by Democrats and embraced by Republican President Donald Trump last week. “As far as the debt ceiling is concerned, we will not be revisiting the debt ceiling until some time next year,” McConnell told reporters. “And getting Congress to give up a tool like that would probably be quite a challenging undertaking.” Congress must periodically raise the debt limit to keep the U.S. government borrowing and operating. Lawmakers sometimes take advantage of that need to push through policy or spending changes.  Trump voiced support last week for the idea of eliminating the statutory cap on the U.S. Treasury Department’s authority to borrow, saying he discussed the possibility with congressional leaders. “It complicates things. It’s really not necessary,” Trump told reporters at the White House on Thursday. At a White House meeting a day earlier, Trump made a surprise deal with Democratic congressional leaders for extending the debt limit for three months tied to hurricane relief legislation and funding for government operations into December. In the meeting, which was also attended by top congressional Republicans and administration officials, Senate Democratic leader Chuck Schumer proposed eliminating the debt limit, and Trump and Vice President Mike Pence said they liked the idea, one person familiar with the meeting said. White House budget chief Mick Mulvaney told Fox News Channel that Trump was frustrated by the way the debt ceiling has been used and had asked him to “explore ways to sort of depoliticize it.” “We’ll continue to work on that. I don’t think the debt ceiling ... will be an issue until January, February of next year,” Mulvaney said. Some Republicans expressed opposition to Trump’s deal with the Democrats, and conservative groups accused the president of caving in rather than insisting on spending cuts to accompany the debt ceiling increase. But the House of Representatives and the Senate, which are both controlled by Republicans, quickly approved the deal, including about $15 billion in hurricane-related aid, and it was signed into law by Trump on Friday.

"Factbox: Trump fills top jobs for his administration. (Reuters) - U.S. President-elect Donald Trump on Wednesday announced he has chosen David Shulkin, who currently heads the Department of Veterans Affairs healthcare system, to head the agency. Here is a list of Republican Trump’s selections for top jobs in his administration.  NOTE: Senate confirmation is required for all the posts except national security adviser and White House posts. Tillerson, 64, has spent his entire career at Exxon Mobil Corp, where he rose to chairman and chief executive officer in 2006. A civil engineer by training, the Texan joined the world’s largest publicly traded energy company in 1975 and led several of its operations in the United States as well as in Yemen, Thailand and Russia. As Exxon’s chief executive, he maintained close ties with Moscow and opposed U.S. sanctions against Russia for its incursion into Crimea. Mnuchin, 54, is a successful private equity investor, hedge fund manager and Hollywood financier who spent 17 years at Goldman Sachs Group Inc before leaving the investment bank in 2002. He assembled an investor group to buy a failed California mortgage lender in 2009, rebranded it as OneWest Bank and built it into Southern California’s largest bank. Housing advocacy groups criticized OneWest for its foreclosure practices, accusing it of being too quick to foreclose on struggling homeowners. Mattis is a retired Marine general known for his tough talk, distrust of Iran and battlefield experience in Iraq and Afghanistan. A former leader of Central Command, which oversees U.S. military operations in the Middle East and South Asia, Mattis, 66, is known by many U.S. forces by his nickname, “Mad Dog.” He was rebuked in 2005 for saying: “It’s fun to shoot some people.” Sessions, 70, was the first U.S. senator to endorse Trump’s presidential bid and has been a close ally since. Son of a country store owner, the lawmaker from Alabama and former federal prosecutor has long taken a tough stance on illegal immigration, opposing any path to citizenship for undocumented immigrants. Coats, 73, served as U.S. senator from Indiana from 1989 to 1999 and again from 2011 to 2017, and was U.S. ambassador to Germany from 2001 to 2005. He previously served as U.S. representative from Indiana’s 4th Congressional District. Zinke, 55, a first-term Republican U.S. representative from Montana and a member of the House subcommittee on natural resources, has voted for legislation that would weaken environmental safeguards on public lands. He has taken stances favoring the coal industry, which suffered during the Obama administration. The League of Conservation Voters, which ranks lawmakers on their environmental record, gave Zinke an extremely low lifetime score of 3 percent. Ross, 79, heads the private equity firm WL Ross & Co. Forbes has pegged his net worth at about $2.9 billion. A staunch supporter of Trump, Ross helped shape the Trump campaign’s views on trade policy. He blames massive U.S. factory job losses on the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA) with Canada and Mexico, which went into force in 1994, and the 2001 entry of China into the World Trade Organization.      Lighthizer, 69, served as deputy U.S. trade representative during the Reagan administration in the 1980s and has since spent nearly three decades as a lawyer representing U.S. companies in anti-dumping and anti-subsidy cases, currently with the law firm Skadden, Arps, Slate, Meagher and Flom. A harsh critic of China’s trade practices, Lighthizer in 2010 told Congress that U.S. policymakers should take a more aggressive approach in dealing with the Asian country. Puzder, chief executive officer of CKE Restaurants Inc [APOLOT.UL], which runs the Carl’s Jr. and Hardee’s fast-food chains, has been a vociferous critic of government regulation of the workplace and the National Labor Relations Board. Puzder, 66, has argued that higher minimum wages would hurt workers by forcing restaurants to close and praises the benefits of automation, so his appointment is likely to antagonize organized labor.  U.S. Representative Price, 62, is an orthopedic surgeon who heads the House Budget Committee. A representative from Georgia since 2005, Price has criticized Obamacare and has championed a plan of tax credits, expanded health savings accounts and lawsuit reforms to replace it. He is against abortion. Shulkin, 57, currently is under secretary for health at the Department of Veterans Affairs, putting him in charge of the country’s largest healthcare system. Shulkin, a physician, was chosen by Democratic President Barack Obama for the under secretary post in 2015. He has spearheaded an effort to cut waiting times for care at VA medical centers. Trump promised during the campaign to improve medical care for veterans. Shulkin would be the first VA secretary who had not served in the military. Carson, 65, is a retired neurosurgeon who dropped out of the Republican presidential nominating race in March and threw his support to Trump. A popular writer and speaker in conservative circles, Carson had been reluctant to take a position in the incoming administration because of his lack of experience in the federal government. He is the first African-American picked for a Cabinet spot by Trump. Chao, 63, was labor secretary under President George W. Bush for eight years and the first Asian-American woman to hold a Cabinet position. She is a director at Ingersoll Rand Plc, News Corp and Vulcan Materials Co. She is married to U.S. Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, a Republican from Kentucky. Perry, 66, is an addition to the list of oil drilling advocates skeptical about climate change who have been picked for senior positions in Trump’s Cabinet. The selections have worried environmentalists but cheered an oil and gas industry eager for expansion. Perry, who ran unsuccessfully for the 2012 Republican presidential nomination and also briefly ran for president in 2016, would be responsible for U.S. energy policy and oversee the nation’s nuclear weapons program.  DeVos, 59, is a billionaire Republican donor, a former chair of the Michigan Republican Party and an advocate for the privatization of education. As chair of the American Federation for Children, she has pushed at the state level for vouchers that families can use to send their children to private schools and for expansion of charter schools. The final leadership role of Kelly’s 45-year military career was head of the U.S. Southern Command, responsible for U.S. military activities and relationships in Latin America and the Caribbean. The 66-year-old retired Marine general differed with Obama on key issues and has warned of vulnerabilities along the United States’ southern border with Mexico. Priebus recently was re-elected to serve as Republican National Committee chairman but will give up that job to join Trump in the White House, where the low-key Washington operative could help forge ties with Congress to advance Trump’s agenda. Priebus, 44, was a steadfast supporter of Trump during the presidential campaign even as the party fractured amid the choice. ENVIRONMENTAL PROTECTION AGENCY ADMINISTRATOR: SCOTT PRUITT An ardent opponent of Obama’s measures to stem climate change, Oklahoma Attorney General Pruitt, 48, has enraged environmental activists. But he fits in with the president-elect’s promise to cut the agency back and eliminate regulation that he says is stifling oil and gas drilling. Pruitt became the top state prosecutor for Oklahoma, which has extensive oil reserves, in 2011 and has challenged the EPA multiple times since. U.S. Representative Mick Mulvaney, 49, a South Carolina Republican, is a fiscal conservative. He was an outspoken critic of former House of Representatives Speaker John Boehner, who resigned in 2015 amid opposition from fellow Republicans who were members of the House Freedom Caucus. Mulvaney was first elected to Congress in 2010. Haley, 44, has been the Republican governor of South Carolina since 2011 and has little experience in foreign policy or the federal government. The daughter of Indian immigrants, she led a successful push last year to remove the Confederate battle flag from the grounds of the South Carolina state capitol after the killing of nine black churchgoers in Charleston by a white gunman. McMahon, 68, is a co-founder and former chief executive of the professional wrestling franchise WWE, which is based in Stamford, Connecticut. She ran unsuccessfully as a Republican for a U.S. Senate seat in Connecticut in 2010 and 2012 and was an early supporter of Trump’s presidential campaign. U.S. Representative Pompeo, 53, is a third-term congressman from Kansas who serves on the House of Representatives Intelligence Committee, which oversees the CIA, National Security Agency and cyber security. A retired Army officer and Harvard Law School graduate, Pompeo supports the U.S. government’s sweeping collection of Americans’ communications data and wants to scrap the nuclear deal with Iran. Walter “Jay” Clayton is a New York-based attorney who advises clients on major Wall Street deals, specializing in public and private mergers and acquisitions and capital-raising efforts. His past clients have included Alibaba Group Holding Company, Oaktree Capital Group and big banks.    Retired Lieutenant General Flynn, 58, was an early Trump supporter and serves as vice chairman on his transition team. He began his Army career in 1981 and was deployed in Afghanistan and Iraq. Flynn became head of the Defense Intelligence Agency in 2012 under Obama but retired a year earlier than expected, according to media reports, and became a fierce critic of Obama’s foreign policy. Tom Bossert, 41, who worked as deputy homeland security adviser to former President George W. Bush, will serve as the assistant to the president for homeland security and counterterrorism. He currently runs a risk management consulting firm and has a cyber risk fellowship with the Atlantic Council think tank in Washington. Cohn, 56, president and chief operating officer of Goldman Sachs, had widely been considered heir apparent to Lloyd Blankfein, CEO of the Wall Street firm. Trump hammered Goldman and Blankfein during the presidential campaign, releasing a television ad that called Blankfein part of a “global power structure” that had robbed America’s working class. Navarro, 67, has suggested a stepped-up engagement with Taiwan, including assistance with a submarine development program. A professor at the University of California, Irvine, who advised Trump during the campaign, Navarro argued that Washington should stop referring to the “one China” policy, but stopped short of suggesting it should recognize Taipei: “There is no need to unnecessarily poke the Panda.” Viola, 60, is a graduate of the U.S. Military Academy at West Point and a U.S. Army veteran who served in the famed 101st Airborne Division. He founded high-frequency trading firm Virtu Financial Inc and served as chairman of the New York Mercantile Exchange, where he began his financial services career. After the Sept. 11, 2001, al Qaeda attacks on New York and Washington, Viola helped found the Combating Terrorism Center at West Point. He is an owner of the Florida Panthers ice hockey team. CHIEF WHITE HOUSE STRATEGIST, SENIOR COUNSELOR: STEVE BANNON The former head of the conservative website Breitbart News came aboard as Trump’s campaign chairman in August. A rabble-rousing conservative media figure, he helped shift Breitbart into a forum for the alt-right, a loose confederation of those who reject mainstream politics and includes neo-Nazis, white supremacists and anti-Semites. His hiring signals Trump’s dedication to operating outside the norms of Washington. As White House chief of staff, Bannon, 63, will serve as Trump’s gatekeeper and agenda-setter. ",0,en

"Austria's far-right stakes claim to interior ministry ahead of coalition talks. VIENNA (Reuters) - Austria s far-right Freedom Party (FPO) on Wednesday named control of the interior ministry as its price for joining a future coalition government following its strong showing in a parliamentary election. The anti-immigrant, anti-Islam FPO won around 26 percent of votes cast in Sunday s election. The conservative People s Party (OVP) won most votes by also taking a hard line on immigration, while the centre-left Social Democrats took second place. Asked if the FPO would stick by its pre-election insistence that it would only join a future coalition if its candidate became interior minister, party leader Heinz-Christian Strache told reporters:  Yes.   We won t go down on our knees for anyone. At 26 percent we naturally aim to implement our (FPO) policies in government,  Strache added. The interior ministry in Austria oversees asylum claims and the fight against terrorism, among other responsibilities. Austria s president will on Friday formally ask Sebastian Kurz, leader of the OVP, the largest party at around 32 percent, to start negotiations on forming a new coalition government. The OVP and the FPO overlap in their plans to curb immigration, cut social benefits for refugees, reduce the tax burden on companies and work towards repatriating powers to national governments from Brussels while strengthening external border security. (Click tmsnrt.rs/2yVUDsq for Election graphic) All parties have kept their coalition options open, but the Social Democrats (SPO) are technically still bound by a party conference decision from 2014 that bans it from entering into a coalition government with the Freedom Party.  Under Austria s outgoing Social Democrat chancellor, Christian Kern, the SPO has opened up significantly to the Freedom Party by introducing a so-called  value compass  for potential partners which does not specifically rule out working with the Freedom Party. But Strache said on Wednesday that as long as there was no fresh vote among the Social Democrats  base to formally annul the 2014 decision, talk of his party teaming up with the SPO was  theoretical . Influential FPO official Manfred Haimbuchner told newspaper Der Standard that he definitely preferred his party to form a government with the conservatives. The FPO was founded by ex-Nazis in the 1950s and first became a major political force in the 1990s under the charismatic Joerg Haider, who praised Hitler s employment policies. Today the party says it has put its Nazi past behind it and purged its ranks of anti-Semitism but still frequently has to expel members for anti-Semitic comments. It has, however, stopped calling for Austria to leave the European Union. For more stories on Austria s election, please see ",0,en

"BREAKING: US SUPREME COURT Upholds U. Of TX-Austin Admissions Ability To Choose Black, Hispanic Students Before White, Asian Students. Obama and the Leftist Supreme Court activists are working overtime to push white students to the back of the line The U.S. Supreme Court on Thursday upheld the University of Texas at Austin s ability to give a slight boost in the admissions process to black and Hispanic applicants, a decision that once again preserved the use of affirmative action at American universities.By a 4-3 vote, the court rejected Sugar Land native Abigail Fisher s claim that she was unfairly discriminated against because she was white. She was denied admission into UT-Austin in 2008, but argued in a lawsuit that black and Hispanic students who were less qualified got in over her.UT-Austin fought the suit, saying it had a right to take race into consideration in a specific, limited way.The ruling almost certainly brings an end to a years-long legal fight over UT-Austin s use of race in admissions   a fight that reached the Supreme Court twice. It will also likely have national implications that will become clearer in the near future. Colleges have been allowed to use affirmative action for decades, and the Supreme Court has upheld the practice each time, though it has limited how it can be used.  Via: Texas Tribune",1,en

" Racist Donald Trump Actually Has The NERVE To Speak About March On Washington Anniversary (TWEET). Monday, August 29, happens to be the 53rd anniversary of the Civil Rights March on Washington, in which civil rights icon Martin Luther King, Jr. made his iconic  I Have a Dream  speech. It is a landmark point in the history of Black Americans gaining legal civil rights. Therefore, the last person who should be speaking out on this event is the racist Republican presidential nominee, Donald Trump. But, speak out he did, and he actually had the unabashed gall to try and pretend he cares about equality. Here is the tweet:Today is the 53rd anniversary of the March on Washington   today we honor the enduring fight for justice, equality and opportunity.  Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) August 28, 2016Now, you must understand, Donald Trump has a long and well-documented history of racism. Here are just a few of those instances:I could go on, but you get the picture. This guy is a dyed in the wool, bona fide racist. He DARES to try and say he cares about equality and justice for minorities, but clearly, he doesn t  just look at his actions, the bigoted nature of his campaign, as well as the people he surrounds himself with. Further, his so-called  outreach  is only Trump s attempt to be a white whisperer to those white people who are too uncomfortable to vote for him if they sincerely believe him to be a racist. Newsflash, folks: Donald Trump IS a racist. His history and the nature of his campaign shows it. He s only pandering for votes because he knows he cannot win in November with only white people. Do not be fooled   Trump is a racist demagogue, and no amount of attempting to pander and change his language changes that.Featured image via Ralph Freso/Getty Images",1,en

" Conservative Commentator Uses Nancy Reagan’s Death To Launch Racist Attack On Michelle Obama (TWEETS). When news of the death of former First Lady Nancy Reagan came through on Sunday, the majority of liberals and conservatives put aside their differences to send condolences to the family and reflect on her contribution to the nation. But for one conservative commentator, it was the perfect opportunity to attack First Lady Michelle Obama.Conservative blogger and trollumnist Debbie Schlussel struck out on Twitter on Sunday with this pathetic assault on the First Lady.Nancy Reagan brought style & glamour back to the White House & Then Michelle Hussein Obama Took It Away. RIP #tcot #gop #NancyReagan  Debbie Schlussel (@DebbieSchlussel) March 6, 2016Schlussel is a what one might refer to as an ultra-Zionist, a hardliner on Israel who sees no issue with the collective imprisonment and punishment of non-Jews in Israel-Palestine in order to create Jewish Supremacist Apartheid state. To argue on behalf of human rights, democracy and pluralism of race and faith in Israel, is to Schlussel, an anti-Semitic attack.As an example of just how far Schlussel is willing to go to pursue that agenda, check out her response to the murder of American hostage Kayla Mueller by ISIS last year. In a blog post entitled Dead ISIS Hostage Was Jew-Hating, Anti-Israel Bitch,   she wrote that Mueller was:a Jew-hating, anti-Israel piece of crap So, it s poetic justice that Mueller spent her last months as a hostage of the Islamic terrorists with whom she thought she had some sort of kinship and sisterhood. And that she died in their hands.She concludes her piece with the sentence:Buh-bye, Kayla. Have fun with your 72 Yasser Arafats.What evidence was there that Mueller was  jew-hating ? The aid worker s list of previous humanitarian efforts included escorting Palestinian children to school in Hebron in the occupied West Bank, to protect them from violent Jewish-Israeli settlers. The video below is an example of the sort of violence from which the school children need protecting.  Schlussel s attacks on the First Lady and the President are based not on the fact that they are black, but on the presumption that they are Muslim, and that by virtue of being Muslim, they are evil, anti-Semitic and dangerous.Unfortunately for Schlussel, Twitter users were not up for drinking her particular brand of Kool Aid. One person summed it up quite neatly @DebbieSchlussel I bet Mrs. Reagan is spitting on your head from Heaven.  AAmom (@AVD911) March 6, 2016And another @DebbieSchlussel you're actually racist scum  dmbrandon!! (@juiceDiem) March 6, 2016While this person made a rather helpful suggestion.@DebbieSchlussel let some light into your hateful heart   Chuck Daly (@ChuckDaly) March 6, 2016Former Will and Grace star Debra Messing drew attention to Schlussel s tweet, condemning it openly.Shame on you https://t.co/GPNI7EbqBs  Debra Messing (@DebraMessing) March 6, 2016So Schlussel spent the rest of Sunday hate-tweeting Messing (getting no response) for the crime of speaking out against racism.

"AZ POLICE OFFICER Goes To Trump Rally…Shocked At Anti-Trump Protesters Behavior: “Most hateful, evil people that I’ve ever seen”. This police officer is a class act. He went to the Trump rally just to check it out and see what he had to say. He was expecting Trump to be  a lot more radical than he was.  He came in being an undecided voter and left being a Trump supporter. His story mirrors our Trump rally story in Sterling Heights, MI. The people inside the rally waited a long time to see Trump and the room was becoming very hot and uncomfortable. The people in attendance who were there to really hear what he had to say were very respectful of each other. It wasn t until the planted (and likely paid) protesters started screaming at people leaving the event that things got ugly.Brandon Tatum, an officer in the Tucson Police Department, shared a video Saturday night giving his perspective on Donald Trump s campaign rally in Tucson, Arizona   and the disruptive protesters who hurled obscenities at the Republican candidate.Tatum says that as a black man, he did not feel unsafe around Trump s supporters but was ready to fight protesters in self-defense. He calls them the most hateful, evil people he has ever seen.

"Turkey expects S-400 defense system from Russia in 2019: minister. ANKARA (Reuters) - Turkey expects to receive its first Russian S-400 surface-to-air missiles in 2019, Defence Minister Nurettin Canikli said on Wednesday, the first time Ankara has given a firm timeline for a deal that has alarmed its NATO allies. Turkey has been in negotiations with Russia to buy the S-400 for more than a year, a decision seen by Washington and some of its other allies in NATO as a snub to the Western military alliance. Giving the most detail yet on the deal to parliament s budget committee, Canikli said it called for delivery of two S-400 systems, but that the second one was optional. The deal has raised concern among NATO countries in part because the weapons cannot be integrated into the alliance s defenses. Ankara has said it had no choice but to buy the Russian missiles, because NATO countries did not offer a cost-effective alternative.  Once these systems are received, our country will have secured an important air defense capability. This solution aimed at meeting an urgent need will not hinder our commitment to developing our own systems,  he said. Relations between Turkey and Russia deteriorated sharply over years during which they backed opposite sides in the war in neighboring Syria, but have improved markedly over the past year. The countries are now cooperating on Syrian peace efforts.  Canikli said Turkey was also in talks with the Franco-Italian EUROSAM consortium on developing its own missile defense systems, after signing a memorandum to strengthen cooperation between the three countries in defense projects.  With the memorandum in question, Turkish, French and Italian firms have started cooperation to identify, develop, produce and use a more advanced version of the SAMP-T (missile system) in a common consortium,  he said. Turkey aimed to bring talks with EUROSAM to a  definitive end  soon, he said, adding that Ankara aimed to finalize the deal by the end of 2017 at the latest. Turkey has been working to develop its own defense systems and equipment, and has lined up several projects for the coming years, including combat helicopters, tanks, drones and more. Canikli said Turkey received bids last Friday for the production of 500 Altay battle tanks, of which 250 are optional.  Shares of Turkish commercial and military vehicle producer Otokar rose almost 3 percent following the news about the 7 billion euro ($8.24 billion) domestic tank project. ",0,en

MANILA (Reuters) - U.S. President Donald Trump said on Tuesday he had made clear during his trip to Asia that the United States was open to trading with other countries, but only if conditions were fair for his country. Trade and concern about possible protectionism under Trump s  America First  agenda have come up during his regional visit, which has included stops in Japan, South Korea, China, Vietnam and the Philippines.  We ve explained that the United States is open for trade but we want reciprocal, we want fair trade for the United States,  he told reporters in Manila during a summit of Asian leaders, where integrating economies and curbing protectionism has been on the agenda.

"Turkey releases French journalist detained on Iraqi border. PARIS (Reuters) - Turkey on Friday released French journalist Loup Bureau who was seized by security forces on the Iraqi border last month, his lawyer said on Friday. Bureau was detained by Turkish border guards in early August after he was found to have photographs and interviews with Kurdish militia fighters among his possessions.   We are pleased to announce the release of journalist #LoupBureau. He will be expelled from Turkey shortly,  lawyer Martin Pradel said via Twitter. French President Emmanuel Macron last month expressed his concerns about Bureau s detention in a telephone call with Turkish President Tayyip Erdogan. The announcement came as French Foreign Affairs Minister Jean-Yves Le Drian concluded a two-day visit to Turkey. Turkey considers the Kurdish YPG militia, with which Bureau is accused of having links, to be an extension of the Kurdistan Workers Party (PKK) militant group. The PKK has fought a three-decade insurgency in southeast Turkey and is designated a terrorist organization by Ankara, the United States and the European Union. Bureau s lawyer said a Turkish court had not closed the case.  We must continue to fight,  Pradel said in another tweet. ",0,en
" Bill Maher Takes Down Trump’s Lying Chief Of Staff In BLISTERING Rebuke (VIDEO).  White House Chief of Staff John Kelly is a Four Star Marine General who gave his son to this nation. That is why it was such a relief when he joined the Trump White House. Everyone thought he d bring order to a dangerously chaotic situation. However, as Donald Trump s attacks on Rep. Frederica Wilson (D-FL) in the midst of a Gold Star family s grief, General Kelly revealed his true colors. Instead of smoothing things over, he escalated the attacks, and actually lied about Rep. Wilson from the White House press podium. Well, one person isn t having any of this crap: Comedian and host of HBO s Real Time Bill Maher.During a blistering statement on his Friday night panel, Maher said of Kelly: He smeared and lied. He smeared that congresslady and he lied about it. He was supposed to be the Trump-minder, but now he acts like Trump. You can be this guy that everybody says  you are the man of unimpeachable integrity,  or you can take political hit shots and be the hatchet man. You can t do both. Maher is correct. Kelly s integrity is no longer unimpeachable, because he chose to utter provable lies from the White House press podium and has also chosen not to apologize for it. He defended the indefensible with regards to Trump s appalling statements to the Myeshia Johnson, the grieving widow of Army Sergeant La David Johnson. With that, Kelly smeared something that is supposed to be sacred, and he cannot take that back.I never thought I d say this about a man who has given so much to this country   including his own son   but here it is: Shame on you, John Kelly.

" Obama’s Doing Something BIG To Raise Pay For Millions Of Americans (VIDEO). Throughout his presidency, President Obama has dedicated himself to exploring policies with the goal of making life better for working Americans and making sure they are fairly compensated for their time and effort.Unfortunately, the GOP has become a major obstacle for the President ever since he stepped foot in the White House. After a Republican Congress made it perfectly clear that they won t even consider a minimum wage increase, the Obama administration was forced to seek out another alternative   and it s finally going to pay off. Thanks to Obama s overhaul on overtime pay   which doubles the salary level that workers must be paid overtime, millions of Americans are going to have more money in their pockets. This is major news, because this law hasn t been changed in over ten years!When Obama first mentioned that he wanted to revamp overtime pay, hardly anyone took him seriously. At his State of the Union address last year, the President said,  We still need to make sure employees get the overtime they ve earned.  Then, he unveiled a proposal to raise the income thresholds for those who would be eligible for overtime. It still seemed like faraway goal, until yesterday when the Labor Department finalized those new rules   an initiative that the Huffington Post called  one of the most ambitious economic reforms of the Obama era. Vice President Joe Biden announced the decision on Tuesday, stating that middle-class workers have  been getting clobbered  for decades. Biden said: The American people want to work. They want a fair shot. No handouts, no guarantees. Just a good job at a fair wage. Under the new rules, all workers earning salaries under the overtime salary threshold are entitled to time-and-a-half pay when they work over 40 hours per week   which many do. The previous threshold was only $23,660   making millions of struggling, hard-working Americans ineligible. But thanks to the Obama administration, that number will be doubled to $47,476, which guarantees overtime rights for any salaried workers earning underneath that number. Before this was changed, only 7% of Americans were eligible for overtime. And it gets better   the threshold will be updated by the Labor Department every three years to make sure that it keeps up with inflation.

"BREAKING: SOCIALIST BRAZIL Declares FINANCIAL DISASTER Less Than 2 Months Before Start Of Olympics. Corruption and socialism go hand in hand Brazil is no exception!Here s the backstory on the corrupt Brazillian President and how she drained the coffers. It hasn t helped that the lower oil prices have devastated Brazil s economy:The impeachment of Brazilian President Dilma Rousseff is about more than cooking the books to hide election-year spending or looting the state-owned oil company for her campaigns and cronies. What s really on trial are Rousseff s socialist policies.Those policies drove up deficits to win votes, bet too heavily on exports to China and not only failed to retool the world s ninth-largest economy to compete in the world but drove it into a recession.Rousseff was first elected in 2010 on the coattails of her mentor Luiz In cio  Lula  da Silva   a leftist labor leader who exceeded expectations as president from 2003-2011. Da Silva benefited from the windfall of revenue from exports of oil, natural gas, minerals and agriculture goods   which convinced him that his bloated anti-poverty programs were sustainable.Unfortunately, both da Silva and Rousseff ignored the dire need to improve education, reform tangled tax codes, fix stifling labor laws, invest in infrastructure or make it easier to create or operate a business.

If you ve ever wondered why the United States gives Israel billions of dollars a year in so-called assistance, you need not wonder anymore.  It s all about working the system, and pro-Israel lobbyists and billionaires like casino mogul Sheldon Edelson know exactly what they are doing to exploit the American process: They buy American politicians.Presumptive Republican nominee Donald Trump is about to receive a big present from Sheldon Adelson of $100 million for his campaign. However, there is an exchange here: If Trump becomes president, then he must ensure that the U.S. continue its unwavering financial support for Israel despite the fact that we can t afford clean water in Flint and our national infrastructure is failing. The U.S. also sends billions to Israel despite the fact that Israel has been ethnically cleansing Palestinians since 1947 and treats them in a way that civil rights activist Desmond Tutu described as worse than the apartheid regime that existed in South Africa.How much money does the U.S. give to Israel?The state of Israel currently receives a staggering $3 billion a year in so-called aid, much of it for its military, which is then used to brutalize the Palestinian people in the form of a military occupation and a settlement apparatus of land theft that is illegal under international law. With the current agreement set to expire in 2017, Israel wants a raise. They are now asking for an estimated $5 billion a year over the next ten years, for a total of more than $50 billion. In fact, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu arrogantly rejected President Obama s recent offer, which is about $40 billion over ten years. Israel has said that it may hold out for the next president in order to get a better deal.According to Sheldon Adelson, that next president may be Donald Trump. The $100 million he will give to Trump may seem substantial but Adelson, whose loyalties are with Israel, is willing to spend $100 million in order to receive billions for the apartheid state in return. Here s what Donald Trump tweeted about Adelson s previous support for former candidate Marco Rubio:Sheldon Adelson is looking to give big dollars to Rubio because he feels he can mold him into his perfect little puppet. I agree!  Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) October 13, 2015Since the campaign money is now coming Trump s way, you can bet that Trump is ready to be Israel s puppet and give it what it wants. In an attempt to court big pro-Israel donors, Trump has already stated that he supports the continuation of illegal settlement construction in the Palestinian West Bank. The billions of  dollars that will help Israel continue to rob and oppress the Palestinians will come from fleecing the U.S. taxpayer of money that instead can go to our schools and our healthcare system.Donald Trump is just another political phony who is willing to sell his own country down the river to the highest foreign bidder for personal power.Watch video here:[youtube https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b1eNaH-D_5I]Featured image via video screenshot.",1,en

"Qatar emir says open to Trump-hosted talks over Gulf crisis: CBS. DOHA (Reuters) - Qatar s ruler said he is ready for U.S.-hosted direct talks aimed at solving the worst diplomatic crisis in the Gulf in years but has yet to hear a response to U.S. President Donald Trump s invitation to the four Arab states boycotting Doha. Speaking to U.S. broadcaster CBS News, Qatari Emir Sheikh Tamim bin Hamad al-Thani said he wanted an end to the dispute, which erupted on June 5 and pits Saudi Arabia, Bahrain, the United Arab Emirates and Egypt against Qatar.  Nothing is going to be above our dignity, our sovereignty. But we want it to end. I always say that,  he told the  60 Minutes  program in an interview aired on Sunday.  If they (are) going to walk one meter toward me, I m willing to walk 10,000 miles towards them,  he said. The four countries have cut diplomatic, transport and trade ties with Qatar, the world s top seller of liquefied natural gas, accusing it of financing terrorism. Doha denies the charges. The dispute has hit travel and food imports and ratcheted up tensions in a wealthy region which plays a leading role in global energy markets as well as events across the wider Middle East.  On Sunday, Bahrain s foreign minister called for freezing Qatar s membership out of the Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC) to preserve its unity, adding that Bahrain will not attend the upcoming GCC summit if Qatar does not change its stand. Qatar hosts Al Udeid air base, the largest U.S. military facility in the Middle East. Sheikh Tamim said Trump had told him  I will not accept my friends fighting amongst themselves,  and that in talks on the sidelines of a United Nations  meeting in September he had made an offer to host talks in the United States.  I told him straightaway,  Mr President, we are very ready. I ve been asking for dialogue from day one,  Sheikh Tamim said, adding that the meeting was supposed to happen very soon and that he had not heard a response from the other countries. Trump, who has said he would be willing to mediate in the dispute, said in September he had a  very strong feeling  it would be solved  pretty quickly . Earlier in September, Saudi Arabia suspended any dialogue with Qatar, accusing it of  distorting facts,  just after a report of a phone call between the leaders of the two countries suggested a possible breakthrough in the dispute. Saudi Arabia s Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman spoke by  phone with Qatar s emir on Sept. 8 in the first publicly reported contact between the two leaders since the crisis began. There has been no further contact reported since then. In the CBS interview, Sheikh Tamim reiterated that Qatar would not close down the Doha-based Al Jazeera television network, as demanded by the four countries who accuse the broadcaster of bias and interfering in their affairs. Al Jazeera says it is an independent news service giving a voice to everyone in the region. Sheikh Tamim also said he feared for the region if any military actions were taken as part of the crisis.  I m fearful that if anything happens, if any military act happens, this region will be in chaos,  he said. ",0,en
"UK terrorism arrests soar to record level after attacks this year. LONDON (Reuters) - The number of people arrested in Britain on suspicion of terrorism offences rocketed by 68 percent in the last year to the highest figure on record during a period when the country suffered four deadly attacks, figures showed on Thursday. Statistics from the Home Office (interior ministry) showed there were 379 arrests in the year to June, up from 226 from the 12 previous months, and the most since 2001 when the data began to be collected. Britain is on its second-highest threat level,  severe , meaning an attack is highly likely and 36 people were killed in terrorist incidents in the first six months of 2017. Among the arrests, 12 came after an attack in March on London s Westminster Bridge when a man drove a car into pedestrians killing four, before he stabbed a policeman to death outside parliament. Another 23 followed a suicide bombing at a pop concert in Manchester in May, and the following month police arrested 21 suspects after three Islamist militants drove into pedestrians on London Bridge before stabbing people at nearby restaurants and bars, killing eight. One arrest followed an attack in north London when a van was driven into worshippers near a mosque which left one man dead. Britain s most senior counter-terrorism officer Mark Rowley has said police have been arresting a suspect every day. He said this week that there had been a shift in the threat level rather than an isolated spike. In the three years until March this year, police foiled 13 potential attacks but in the next 17 weeks, there were the four attacks while the authorities thwarted six others, Rowley said.  The pace has continued to be almost as challenging since then,  he told a conference in Israel. The official figures showed that among the 379 arrests, 123 people were charged with an offense, of which 105 were terrorism-related, while 189 were released without charge. ",0,en

"Three U.S. senators ask Mylan for EpiPen military reimbursements. (Reuters) - Three members of the U.S. Senate Judiciary Committee, ahead of a planned hearing late this month, said Mylan NV appears to have greatly overcharged the military for its lifesaving allergy treatment EpiPen and asked the pharmaceutical company when it plans to reimburse the Department of Defense. The reimbursement demand came in a letter on Monday to Mylan Chief Executive Heather Bresch, from Senate Judiciary Chairman Charles Grassley, an Iowa Republican, and committee members Richard Blumenthal of Connecticut and Amy Klobuchar of Minnesota, both Democrats. “We are alarmed that Mylan may have overcharged our military for this life-saving drug,” the Senators wrote. They said Mylan for years may have knowingly misclassified EpiPen as a generic product in order to avoid higher rebates the company would have had to pay state and federal Medicaid programs had it been classified as a branded product. The Medicaid rebate for a generic is 13 percent compared with a minimum of 23.1 percent for a branded medicine. Mylan spokeswoman Nina Devlin declined to comment on the letter, or its demands. The drug company has come under fire from consumers and politicians in recent months for raising the U.S. list price on a pack of two EpiPen injectors nearly six-fold to $600 since 2008. Lawmakers, including Grassley, have called for investigations into Mylan’s pricing, helping put the product in the spotlight amid a larger debate over big drug price increases in the United States.  Pentagon spending on EpiPen jumped to $57 million over the past year from $9 million in 2008, an increase driven by volume and by hefty price hikes that had a bigger bite on prescriptions filled at retail pharmacies, Reuters reported on Oct. 28, citing previously unreported data.   The Pentagon gets a government discount on EpiPens dispensed at military treatment facilities and by mail order. But nearly half of its spending was at retail pharmacies where it most recently paid an average of $509 for EpiPen and $528 for EpiPen Jr two-packs - three times higher than its discounted rate, according to the data. The Senate Judiciary Committee is slated to hold a hearing  Nov. 30 on EpiPen pricing and related matters.    ",0,en

"VIOLENT LEFT EXPOSED: Anti-Trump Latino Sprays Pepper Spray In Faces Of Pro-Trump Women and Children. This is what it looks like when the  tolerant  Left uses violence to promote their phony  tolerance  for others .A loser in the Seattle Seahawks t-shirt really hates Donald Trump. Because he s too stupid to verbalize his position and too cowardly to take on anyone his own size or gender, he decided to express his displeasure with the GOP frontrunner by pepper spraying some women and children at a Pro-Trump rally.Here s the deal: Anaheim, CA city councilwoman Kris Murray introduced a resolution denouncing Donald Trump, which reads in part,  the divisive rhetoric of presidential candidate Donald Trump as contrary to the fundamental principles of the constitutions of California and the United States and as not reflecting Anaheim s guiding principles of inclusiveness and kindness. The LA Daily News reports that more than 50 pro-Trump supporters showed up at the Anaheim City Hall to protest this ridiculous resolution on Tuesday. As you know, wherever there are Trump supporters, there are anti-Trump agitators looking to start a violent confrontation. There s no word on the anti-Trump numbers, but there were enough to be noticed. The news notes that most of these anti-Trump forces were angry young men.As the anti-Trump thugs were yelling at the pro-Trump supporters, one asshole decided to attack a group of women and children, including a 53-year-old grandmother. All I remember is a young man jumped on one of my friends and I told him to get off. Then I got pepper sprayed,  said Linda Reedy.That pepper spray was wielded by the Latino in the Seahawks shirt. Not only did he hit Reedy but also her two young grandchildren and another woman.Paramedics were seen pouring water on their eyes to try and remove the stinging spray. A young girl about 8 years old cried hysterically.It would appear as if someone, possibly Seahawks guy, also punched Reedy in the face as paramedics gave her an icepack for an unspecified facial injury.To recap: one guy attacked a woman and then the Latino pepper sprayed her, a grandmother, and two young children all because they support Donald Trump. If there are a bigger couple of pussies I d like to know who they are because these guys have the #1 and #2 spots locked up in my opinion.Despite the fact that the news was able to capture a very clear picture of the chickenshit pepper sprayer, the dozens of police on the scene were unable to identify or arrest him. No seriously, there were a dozen cops in riot gear, plus many more guarding City Hall, as well as police helicopters overhead and they couldn t apprehend this coward?Let s remember that the reason why everyone was at Anaheim City Hall was because some uppity leftist councilwoman was denouncing Trump for being intolerant. Somehow I think attacking and pepper spraying old women and young children for their beliefs is a million times less tolerant than anything Donald Trump has ever said. Will Anaheim also denounce this Latino asshole and his cohort for what they did? I doubt it.A better question is: will the national media report this assault with the same vigor that they do any time a disruptive idiot gets thrown out of a Trump rally? Again, I doubt it. The official media narrative is that Donald Trump supporters are the violent ones and anti-Trump protesters are peaceful victims of their hate.Via: DownTrend",1,en

"U.S. Attorney General Sessions says to recuse himself when 'appropriate' - NBC News. WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. Attorney General Jeff Sessions said, asked on Thursday about his participation in any investigation into possible ties between Russia and the Trump presidential campaign, said he would recuse himself when “appropriate,” NBC News reported. “Whenever it’s appropriate I will recuse myself, there’s no doubt about that,” Sessions told the network, after saying: “I have not met with any Russians at any time to discuss any political campaign.”  U.S. House Democratic leader Nancy Pelosi called on Sessions to resign on Wednesday after the Washington Post reported he failed to disclose two meetings he had with Russia’s ambassador before Donald Trump was inaugurated as president.

" Trump Put Out A Survey On The Media, And What Happened Is So Hilarious He’s Now Crying ‘RIGGED!’. Trump and his staff are so sure the media lies about everything that they ve put together a  media accountability survey  designed to gauge how people feel about the media, how they re representing Trump and Republicans, and numerous other things. Of course, because true scientific polls don t ever tell them what they want, this survey is anything but scientific. They want to feed their confirmation bias. But what s really happening is hilarious and it s made Trump call his own poll rigged.Seriously.The email that was sent to supporters asking them to take the survey again reads:The President emailed you to take the urgent Mainstream Media Accountability Survey.Since then, mainstream media outlets have viciously attacked it and thousands of Democrats have taken it to try to sabotage the results.Which is why we need your IMMEDIATE help as one of President Trump s biggest supporters.Please take the Mainstream Media Accountability Survey now.>>Thanks,Team Trump Not only does this email demonstrate that Trump is only interested in answers from people who think the exact same way he does, but it also demonstrates the sheer desperation on Trump s part to prove that the media is engaging in one giant conspiracy to bring him down. Or something.The questions in the survey are leading and biased, and were definitely not crafted by an experienced pollster. He wants specific answers and the questions are worded so he s more likely to get those answers:    And those are just a sampling of the questions in the survey.At the end, it asks you for your name, email address and zip code, but there s no verification on it, so you can make up a name and email address, and pick a zip code. Any zip code. And you don t have to create dummy email accounts for it either   so really, what did they expect to happen here?After you fill it out it takes you to a donation page, because of course it does.The bottom line is that, unless he gets the results he s looking for, he s going to keep crying  rigged! If you d like to see what s in it, it can be found here, if you d like to take it for yourself. Repeatedly.Featured image by Sean Rayford via Getty Images",1,en

"Preparing to Invade: US Deploys Additional 2,500 Soldiers for ‘Syria and Iraq’. 21st Century Wire says While the US media continues to lead the public up the garden path by allocating all of its coverage for Obamacare news, the US is quietly ramping-up its forces in the Middle East as the Pentagon quietly positions its assets on the ground in Syria   in preparation for the grand battle to  defeat ISIS. Besides the western media s near blackout of recent US Ranger and Marine deployments on the ground in Syria, what should also worry the public is how the amount of political pressure currently on the embattled Trump White House   might be influencing this Administration s desire to show  a win  militarily in Syria.Military officials spoke to Reuters this week, confirming that rapidly deployable forces in Kuwait are in fact in position as part of an operation to oust ISIS from Raqqa.Already, for months now, several hundred  Special Operations  troops have been embedded with local Kurdish forces.According to the Pentagon reports, at least 6,000 US troops (not including covert operations and private military contractors, possibly an additional 1,000 operatives) are currently operating in both Iraq and Syria.Watch this raw video of one regiment of US troops who arrived in Syria this week: How long until other US NATO allies also arrive with more troops and military assets in Syria?The big risk here could be that the rush to war might be ill-conceived, not to mention completely illegal under international law   considering the United States still refuses to open any dialogue with the sovereign nation state of Syria.In a recent article, 21WIRE s Patrick Henningsen has commented in detail already about the apparent lack of coordination and competing agenda between the US, Turkey, Syria and Russia in northern Syria, including the potential for in-fighting between Coalition forces and their proxies.Meanwhile, the US-led Coalition continues to impose punitive sanctions against Syria, while US allies continue to arm and support numerous radical Wahabi terrorist militant groups who are still destablizing Syria and terrorizing its residents.Expect more assets to be deployed in the coming days and weeks   and more silence from the media Army TimesWASHINGTON   The U.S. military is sending an additional 2,500 ground combat troops to a staging base in Kuwait from which they could be called upon to back up coalition forces battling the Islamic State in Iraq and Syria.The deployment will include elements of the 82nd Airborne Division s 2nd Brigade Combat Team, which is based at Fort Bragg in North Carolina. About 1,700 soldiers from the same unit are overseas now, spread between Iraq and Kuwait. They re focused on the U.S.-led effort to train and assist the Iraqi troops doing much of the fighting against ISIS there.These new personnel, however, will be  postured there to do all things Mosul, Raqqa, all in between,  Army Lt. Gen. Joseph Anderson, the Army s deputy chief of staff for operations, told House lawmakers Wednesday. He was referring to the Islamic State s two main strongholds: Mosul in Iraq and Raqqa in Syria, major urban centers where U.S.-back allies are fighting a well entrenched enemy. So the whole brigade will now be forward,  Anderson said.( ) There are a number of options under consideration as the coalition looks for ways to accelerate the defeat of ISIS,  it says.  We continue to believe that the most effective way to achieve a lasting victory is to do it by, with and through our partner forces who have the greatest stake in the outcome. For operational security reasons, we will not discuss future deployments or contingency operational planning.

New Zealand Green Party leader says wants to form coalition with Labour and New Zealand First. WELLINGTON (Reuters) - New Zealand Green Party leader James Shaw said on Saturday he would be willing to work with Labour Party to form a government with the populist New Zealand First Party as counting showed the ruling National Party on track to secure the most votes but fall short of an outright majority.   Shaw said his message for New Zealand First Party leader Winston Peters was that now was the time to put differences aside and work with Labour to overthrow the incumbent Nationals.     His comments came after 93.7 percent of the results counted showed Labour on 35.7 percent of the vote and center-right National on 46.2 percent. Those results suggested either major party would need New Zealand First to form the next government. The Greens have a working agreement with Labour.

" Report: Trump Won’t Be Handling Foreign Or Domestic Tasks As President. Donald Trump is officially the Republican nominee for President of the United States. Mike Pence is officially the nominee for Vice President of the United States. According to a new report from the New York Times, guess who will be doing almost all of the work?Hint: it won t be Donald Trump.The report, published today, chronicles just how Trump came to settle on Pence instead of the likes of John Kasich, Newt Gingrich, Condoleezza Rice and so forth. But several paragraphs concerning former presidential candidate John Kasich shows the true side of Donald Trump, one that Democrats have been trying to warn the American public about for over a year:One day this past May, Donald Trump s eldest son, Donald Trump Jr., reached out to a senior adviser to Gov. John Kasich of Ohio, who left the presidential race just a few weeks before   Donald Jr. wanted to make him an offer nonetheless: Did he have any interest in being the most powerful vice president in history?When Kasich s adviser asked how this would be the case, Donald Jr. explained that his father s vice president would be in charge of domestic and foreign policy.Then what, the adviser asked, would Trump be in charge of? Making America great again  was the casual reply.And there you have it. What exactly does he mean when he says  making America great again  if he doesn t want to do the only things needed? Trump doesn t want the responsibility of actually being president, he just wants the title and the prestige. Instead of taking it upon himself to deliver on his promises, he s going to dump everything on Mike Pence and sit back and relax while the world crumbles (because everyone knows that wall isn t being built).Congratulations, Republicans, you really picked a winner. He hadn t even decided on who his Vice President would be when he figured out he doesn t want to put in the work to be President.Mike Pence is now poised to become the most powerful V.P. in American historyAnd Republicans say Democrats are lazy and Democrats disgrace the office of the presidency? Once again, the GOP is caught in a corner they can t back out of and it s all thanks to Donald J. Trump.On the second night of the Republican National Convention, Trump s youngest daughter, Tiffany, exulted that her father was a hard worker who never gave up, never stopped dreaming, and never stopped achieving. Well, it turns out he gave up being president of the United States before he has even started.Donald Trump, time and time again, has shown himself to be a lazy, pandering, egomaniacal, narcissistic blowhard. And, not surprisingly, he picked a vice president with the same attributes.  I can t wait to see how his duped electorate tries to justify this. They will somehow blame it on Hillary Clinton or President Obama, because that s what Republicans are good at   blaming others.If Democrats don t get out and vote, say hello to President Trump   eh, President Pence.Featured image via Chip Somodevilla/Getty Images",1,en

"After deadly protests, Indian states in lockdown for 'godman's' rape sentencing. NEW DELHI (Reuters) - India is deploying thousands of riot police and shutting down internet services in two northern states, as it prepares for the sentencing on Monday of a self-styled  godman  whose followers went on the rampage after he was convicted of rape on Friday. Gurmeet Ram Rahim Singh s cult Dera Sacha Sauda has a vast rural following in Punjab and Haryana states, where frenzied mobs burned down gas stations and train stations and torched vehicles after a local court found him guilty of raping two women in a 2002 case. At least 38 people were killed and more than 200 injured in the violence in Haryana, officials said, drawing sharp criticism for the state government run by Prime Minister Narendra Modi s Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP). The case has also highlighted the Indian heartland s fascination with spiritual gurus, who enjoy immense political clout for their ability to mobilize millions of followers frustrated by the shortcomings of the state. Security forces have cordoned off a jail in Rohtak city, 70 km (44 miles) from New Delhi, where Singh - also known as the guru of bling for the clothes he wears in the movies he has starred in - is being held. The judge who convicted Singh will hold a special hearing inside the prison in Rohtak around 2.30 pm local time (0900 GMT) on Monday to decide the punishment, in a move that officials hope will prevent his followers from gathering in the streets like they did on Friday. Singh faces a minimum of seven years in prison. The town of Sirsa, home to Dera s headquarters, is already under lockdown, BS Sandhu, Haryana s police chief, told Reuters. School and colleges have been ordered shut, the government said.  We re fully prepared, we have a contingency plan in place,   Sandhu said, adding that more than 10,000 police would patrol the state as it awaits Singh s sentencing. Neighboring Punjab, where violence was sporadic, has summoned more than 8,000 paramilitary and police, banned large gatherings and switched off mobile internet connections across the state until Tuesday, its top administrator said.  Our intelligence reports caution that there could be arson and some other incidents,  Karan Avtar Singh, the chief secretary to Punjab government, told Reuters. In godman Singh s two films,  Messenger of God  and its sequel, there are sequences in which he fights off villains and tosses burning motorbikes into the air. In his spiritual avatar, Singh dresses in plain white traditional clothes, giving sermons or planting trees. In the movies he dons bejeweled costumes, rides motorbikes and sends bad guys flying. The Haryana government has faced severe criticism from opposition Congress and a state court for failing to stop the rioting and vandalism. Singh, whose verified Twitter profile calls him a saint, philanthropist, sportsman, actor, singer, movie director, writer, lyricists, and autobiographer, has been photographed with senior BJP leaders including Haryana chief minister Manohar Lal Khattar. Last year a Haryana minister announced the state would donate 5 million Indian rupees ($78,000) to Singh s Dera to promote sports. Bir Kumar Yadav, BJP s Haryana spokesman, said the party had been associated with Singh only in his capacity as a social worker who had spread awareness about public sanitation and cleanliness. Modi also weighed in on Sunday, vowing tough action against anyone trying to break the law.  I want to assure my countrymen that people who take the law into their own hands and are on the path of violent suppression - whether it is a person or a group - neither this country nor any government will tolerate it,  he said in his monthly radio address, without directly mentioning the recent violence. Singh s conviction in a rape case is the latest in a series of cases involving spiritual leaders who have been accused of sexually abusing followers, amassing untaxed money and finding favor with politicians. Besides the rape charges, he is also under investigation over allegations that he convinced 400 of his male followers to undergo castration, allegations he denies.

"Trump endorses Romney niece Ronna Romney McDaniel for RNC chair. NEW YORK (Reuters) - U.S. President-elect Donald Trump on Wednesday endorsed a niece of former critic Mitt Romney to be the next chair of the Republican National Committee as he moved to put his stamp on the party leadership. The RNC named Michigan Republican Party chair Ronna Romney McDaniel as its deputy chair, and Trump said he looked forward to her taking over the party leadership. Trump’s incoming White House chief of staff, Reince Priebus, will leave the RNC chairmanship when Trump takes office on Jan. 20. “I’m excited to have a highly effective leader in Ronna McDaniel as RNC deputy chair and I look forward to her serving as the party’s chairman in 2017,” Trump said in a statement. “Ronna has been extremely loyal to our movement and her efforts were critical to our tremendous victory in Michigan, and I know she will bring the same passion to the Republican National Committee,” he added. The RNC’s 168 elected members will convene in January to elect their next chairman and Trump’s endorsement of McDaniel will likely carry enough weight to get her elected. McDaniel’s profile rose in Trump’s view when she helped him win Michigan in the Nov. 8 election. The state had not voted Republican in a presidential election since 1988 and was critical to Trump’s victory over Democrat Hillary Clinton. Her selection came two days after Trump passed over Mitt Romney to be his secretary of state, instead choosing Exxon Mobil Corp Chief Executive Rex Tillerson. Trump and Romney have gotten past their frictions during the Republican presidential nominating battle when the 2012 Republican nominee was critical of Trump’s candidacy. Bob Paduchik, a veteran Republican operative in Ohio who was Trump’s campaign manager in that state, was named deputy co-chair of the RNC. Trump’s victory in Ohio was also crucial to his victory.

"Trump's 1995 tax records suggest no federal taxes for years: New York Times. WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump declared a $916 million loss on his 1995 income tax returns and the large tax deduction may have allowed him to avoid paying federal income taxes for up to 18 years, the New York Times reported on Saturday. The Trump campaign, in a statement responding to the Times report, said that the tax document was obtained illegally and that the New York Times is operating as an extension of the presidential campaign of Democratic rival Hillary Clinton. The Times said it had obtained Trump’s 1995 tax records and that they showed he received the large tax benefits from financial deals that went bad in the early 1990s. The newspaper said that tax experts it hired to analyze Trump’s records said tax rules which are especially advantageous to wealthy filers would have let Trump use his $916 million loss to cancel out an equivalent amount of taxable income over an 18-year period. The Times said that although Trump’s taxable income in subsequent years is as yet unknown, a $916 million loss in 1995 would have been large enough to wipe out more than $50 million a year in taxable income over 18 years. Trump has declined to release his tax records, unlike previous presidential nominees in modern history, saying his taxes are under a federal audit. Experts say he could still release them publicly if he wished. “Mr. Trump is a highly-skilled businessman who has a fiduciary responsibility to his business, his family and his employees to pay no more tax than legally required,” the Trump campaign statement said. “That being said, Mr. Trump has paid hundreds of millions of dollars in property taxes, sales and excise taxes, real estate taxes, city taxes, state taxes, employee taxes and federal taxes, along with very substantial charitable contributions,” it said.

"White House says Israel's new settlement contradicts assurances. WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The White House sharply criticized Israel on Wednesday over its plan for a new settlement building in the West Bank that the White House says undermines the peace process and contradicts assurances from Jerusalem. “We did receive public assurances from the Israeli government that contradict this announcement,” White House spokesman Josh Earnest said at a news briefing. “I guess when we’re talking about how good friends treat one another, that’s a source of serious concern as well.” ",0,en
"France's National Front on verge of split after election setback. PARIS (Reuters) - Four months after a heavy electoral defeat, France s National Front is on the verge of a split between its leader and her chief deputy that could open the way to a policy change on the euro as the far-right party seeks to rebrand itself.   Marine Le Pen s relationship with Florian Philippot, for years her closest aide, has become so strained since she lost the presidential election to centrist Emmanuel Macron that far-right experts say it has reached the point of no-return. A rupture would mark an important change for the FN and Le Pen because she has for years defended Philippot s anti-euro, protectionist line against critics in the party, and built her 2012 and 2017 presidential campaigns on his advice. Philippot has been under fire in the party over its setbacks in this year s presidential and parliamentary elections, with many blaming the anti-euro line he has backed so strongly.  Le Pen, whose leadership is also under scrutiny, has increasingly distanced herself from Philippot, focusing on the party s anti-immigration, identitarian roots in speeches rather than the party s stance on the euro. Philippot has stood firm, maintaining that opposing the euro is a vote winner.  Le Pen has now issued him an ultimatum, saying he must decide between his party role and a think-tank group known as the Patriots that he has set up focused on an anti-euro policy.   I don t intend to abandon the Patriots nor my convictions nor my ideals,  a visibly shaken Philippot said in an interview on CNews.  If they want to get rid of me and prevent me from working on the relaunch of the National Front, then let it be done,  he added. Minutes later Le Pen issued a terse statement saying she had decide to revoke his responsibilities for strategy and communications, but stopped short of firing him as vice president - for now. Jerome Fourquet, a specialist on the far-right at pollster Ifop, sees the split as definitive.   This seems to have escalated to a point of no-return,  he said. If Philippot leaves the party or is forced out, it could at first cause further turmoil for the far-right as it struggles to portray itself as the main opposition to Macron, despite having reached the second round of the presidential election in May. In the presidential run-off, Le Pen secured 34 percent of the vote against 66 percent for Macron   its strongest election performance but still a disappointment. In June s parliamentary election, the national Front won only eight seats.   The role of chief opponent has been assumed by Jean-Luc Melenchon, leader of the far-left France Insoumise (France Unbowed), who together with unions is leading calls for mass protests against reforms planned by Macron. The departure of Philippot, a graduate of France s top ENA administrative school, could be followed by others in the party with a similar profile walking out, depriving the party of figures who were key to policy-making. Le Pen and her party might, however, see long-term gains as his exit could enable her to reassert her authority and make it easier to shift policy on the euro. This might in turn help the FN forge alliances with other right-wing politicians.   If Philippot was to leave there would be a negative buzz, there would be turmoil in the FN, but after a while that would likely be digested and overcome,  Fourquet said. He underlined that the party had survived previous crises, such as the departure in the late 1990s of Bruno Megret, once a political star who took allies with him. Analysts say Philippot has fewer loyal allies and a smaller political capital than Megret did at the time and would therefore be unlikely to create a rival party that would pose a serious threat to the FN.              The deadline for the FN to decide how it wants to rebrand itself is March, when it will hold a party congress to decide on a new name and what its strategies and policies should be for the next presidential election due in 2022.         Jean Messiha, who coordinated Le Pen s presidential manifesto, said the party was in a difficult phase where it was adapting to France s changed political landscape.  We need to get our act together and, most importantly, we need Marine Le Pen to reaffirm, to reassert her authority,  he told Reuters. Le Pen s partner, senior FN official Louis Aliot, made a similar point, telling supporters at the weekend not to give in to  defeatism .  In politics, you re never dead,  he said. ",0,en

"Syria demands pullout of Turkish troops from country, says it is a ""flagrant aggression"". AMMAN (Reuters) - Syria demanded on Saturday that Turkish troops who had entered northwestern Syria leave immediately, saying their presence constituted a  flagrant aggression . A Foreign Ministry statement carried on state media said the entry of Turkish military vehicles into rebel-held northwest Syria through the Bab al-Hawa crossing late on Thursday was a violation of international law.   Syria condemns in the strongest terms the incursion of units of the Turkish army in Idlib province, which constitutes a flagrant aggression against the sovereignty and security of Syrian territory,  the statement said. Turkey says it is operating alongside Syrian rebel groups to implement a deal reached last month with Russia and Iran in the Kazakh capital Astana to reduce fighting between insurgents. But Syria s statement said:  The Turkish aggression is not tied in any way with the understandings that were reached between the guarantor states in the Astana process, but constitutes a violation of these understandings.

"CHICAGO THUGS Watched 9 Yr Old Play On Swings Before Carrying Out His Brutal Murder In Retaliation Against Dad’s Gang. UPDATE: No #BlackLivesMatter Protests PlannedChicago has no shortage of thugs. What they do have a shortage of is support from the #BlackLivesMatter terrorists and Obama Regime. You don t hear our Community Organizer In Chief running to a microphone every time a young black man or woman is murdered at the hands of another black man or woman. Sadly, it doesn t fit their narrative. This young boy s murder is far more tragic than the plight of the Muslim boy, with a history of discipline issues, who took a fake bomb to school in Texas on 9-11 and was rightly punished for his behavior by school officials. The phony outrage that Obama showed the world over this little fake  clock boy s  arrest should sicken every American. It is especially disturbing when one considers Obama s deafening silence over the horrific gang violence that plagues his hometown of Chicago. Where were the tweets of outrage from the White House over the loss of this beautiful young boy s life? Crickets On Friday, prosecutors laid out their case against a man accused of murdering 9-year-old Tyshawn Lee on Nov. 2Corey Morgan, 27, of suburban Lansing, was charged in the murder. Police have one other man in custody who has not yet been charged, and a third man, Kevin Edwards, is also wanted in the slaying.Prosecutors say Corey Morgan (left) and Kevin Edwards planned the heinous murder of 9-year-old Tyshawn Lee.Assistant State s Attorney George Canellis said Friday the shooting stemmed from an ongoing feud between Morgan s gang, the BBG (Bang Bang Gang)/Terror Dome faction of the Black P Stones and the Killaward faction of the Gangster Disciples.The feud came to a boil after an Oct. 13 shooting in which Morgan s brother, Tracey Morgan was killed and his mother was wounded. Morgan was so enraged he threatened to shoot  grandmas, mamas, kids and all  in retaliation, prosecutors said.Tyshawn was hit in his back, forearm and head, and part of his thumb was shot off as if he was raising his hand to block the shots, Canellis said. This murder was committed in a cold, calculated and premeditated manner,  Canellis said.Chicago Police Superintendent Garry McCarthy vowed to destroy the group responsible for the boy s brutal murder. They are going to be obliterated,  he said.  That gang just signed its death warrant. McCarthy did not detail each suspect s role in the shooting. We know that there were three individuals involved in this,  he said.Morgan s arrest comes nearly a month after Tyshawn s Nov. 2 shooting death.Police are hunting for Kevin Edwards, also suspected in the shooting.Court documents paint a disturbing picture of the planned attack, explaining that Morgan and his accomplices allegedly saw Tyshawn playing on the swings in a playlot with his basketball beside him. One of the suspects allegedly started dribbling Tyshawn s ball, ultimately luring him into the alley where police say he was  executed.

"Japan defends Toyota after Trump broadside over Mexican plant. TOKYO (Reuters) - The Japanese government defended Toyota Motor Corp (7203.T) on Friday as an “important corporate citizen” of the United States, after President-elect Donald Trump singled out the automaker and threatened to slap punitive tariffs on its Mexico-built cars. Trump has repeatedly hit out at U.S. companies for using lower-cost factories abroad at the expense of jobs at home. He has slammed U.S. automakers, including Ford (F.N) which this week scrapped a planned $1.6 billion Mexico plant. But the attack overnight on Toyota is his first against a foreign automaker. “Toyota Motor said will build a new plant in Baja, Mexico, to build Corolla cars for U.S. NO WAY! Build plant in U.S. or pay big border tax,” Trump tweeted. Toyota shares fell more than 3 percent before recovering, and Honda Motor Co (7267.T) and Nissan Motor Co (7201.T) slid around 2 percent - even as the government and analysts sought to brush off the impact of the attack.  Chief Cabinet Secretary Yoshihide Suga told reporters on Friday that Toyota was an “important corporate citizen”, while Trade Minister Hiroshige Seko stressed the contribution of Japanese companies to U.S. employment. “We think the impact on business performance is limited,” Akira Kishimoto, a senior analyst at JP Morgan, said in a note. “A cool judgement is needed.”     Toyota’s exposure to Mexico is limited, Kishimoto said, adding that even an “extreme case” tariff of 20 percent would hit its operating profit by around 6 percent. Trump has threatened a 35 percent tariff on cars imported from Mexico. Toyota is just one of a host of companies operating in Mexico. It has an assembly plant in Baja California, where it produces the Tacoma pick-up truck, and where it could increase production. Trump’s tweet, however, confused Toyota’s existing Baja plant with the planned $1 billion plant in Guanajuato, where construction got under way in November, days after the election. The Guanajuato plant will build Corollas and have an annual capacity of 200,000 when it comes online in 2019, shifting production of the small car from Canada.  Baja produces around 100,000 pick-up trucks and truck beds annually. Toyota said in September it would increase output of pick-up trucks by more than 60,000 units annually.  Other Japanese automakers and suppliers in Mexico include Nissan, which has been in Mexico for decades after choosing it as the site for its first assembly plant outside Asia. Nissan has two facilities there, producing 830,000 units in the year to March 2016. Honda operates two assembly and engine plants with a total annual capacity of 263,000 vehicles, and a transmission plant with an annual capacity of 350,000 units.       Aisin Seiki Co (7259.T) and Denso Corp (6902.T), both suppliers to Toyota and other carmakers, have two and three plants, respectively, in Mexico. Parts makers tend to cluster near assembly plants under the industry’s “just-in-time” production philosophy.  ",0,en

"Key Republican Collins has 'serious concerns' on healthcare bill. WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Republican Senator Susan Collins of Maine said on Sunday she has extreme reservations about the U.S. Senate’s healthcare overhaul and does not think it will be able to pass this week. Collins, a moderate Republican who has not taken a formal stance on the bill, said she was concerned it would cut Medicaid too deeply and said she wants to see an upcoming analysis by the Congressional Budget Office before making a decision. “I have very serious concerns about the bill,” she said on ABC’s “This Week” program. “It’s hard for me to see the bill passing this week.” Republican Senate leader Mitch McConnell of Kentucky has pushed for a vote before the July 4th Independence Day holiday recess that begins at the end of this week. He can afford to lose the support of only two Republicans in the face of unanimous Democratic opposition. Five Republican senators have announced they will not support the bill, which is designed to repeal and replace Obamacare, in its current form. One of those senators, Ron Johnson of Wisconsin, called on Sunday for a slowdown in the process to give the Senate and the public time to evaluate the healthcare bill. “We don’t have enough information. I don’t have the feedback from constituencies who will not have had enough time to view the Senate bill. We should not be voting on this next week,” he said on NBC’s “Meet the Press.” Another senator who has announced that he does not support the current version of the bill, Rand Paul of Kentucky, said he would back it if the Senate reached an impasse on healthcare. “If we get to impasse, if we go to a bill that is more repeal and less big government programs, yes I’ll consider partial repeal,” Paul said on ABC. The Senate’s 142-page proposal, worked out in secret by a group led by McConnell, aims to deliver on a central campaign promise of President Donald Trump to undo former President Barack Obama’s signature healthcare law, which has provided coverage to 20 million Americans since it was passed in 2010. Republicans view the law, formally known as the Affordable Care Act, as a costly government intrusion and say individual insurance markets created by it are collapsing. “I think they have, at best, a 50-50 chance of passing this bill,” Senate Democratic leader Chuck Schumer of New York said on ABC. He said Democrats “are doing everything we can to fight this bill because it’s so devastating for the middle class.” The House of Representatives has passed a measure similar to the Senate plan. The Senate would phase out Obamacare’s expansion of the Medicaid program for the poor more gradually than the House bill, waiting until after the 2020 presidential election, but would enact deeper cuts starting in 2025.

"The Existential Question Of Whom To Trust. 21st Century Wire says Investigative reporter Robert Parry broke many of the Iran-Contra stories for The Associated Press and Newsweek in the 1980 s and has been a featured guest on Patrick Henningsen LIVE at 1100KFNX.  In this report, Robert asks due to mainstream media experts who ve fallen to  careerism , whom can we trust to deliver us the information to describe the world and its conflicts. (Image   Former Secretary of State, Colin Powell addressing the United Nations on Feb. 5. 2003)Robert Parry Consortium NewsThe looming threat of World War III, a potential extermination event for the human species, is made more likely because the world s public can t count on supposedly objective experts to ascertain and evaluate facts. Instead, careerism is the order of the day among journalists, intelligence analysts and international monitors   meaning that almost no one who might normally be relied on to tell the truth can be trustedThe dangerous reality is that this careerism, which often is expressed by a smug certainty about whatever the prevailing groupthink is, pervades not just the political world, where lies seem to be the common currency, but also the worlds of journalism, intelligence and international oversight, including United Nations agencies that are often granted greater credibility because they are perceived as less beholden to specific governments but in reality have become deeply corrupted, too.In other words, many professionals who are counted on for digging out the facts and speaking truth to power have sold themselves to those same powerful interests in order to keep high-paying jobs and to not get tossed out onto the street. Many of these self-aggrandizing professionals   caught up in the many accouterments of success   don t even seem to recognize how far they ve drifted from principled professionalism.A good example was Saturday night s spectacle of national journalists preening in their tuxedos and gowns at the White House Correspondents Dinner, sporting First Amendment pins as if they were some brave victims of persecution. They seemed oblivious to how removed they are from Middle America and how unlikely any of them would risk their careers by challenging one of the Establishment s favored groupthinks. Instead, these national journalists take easy shots at President Trump s buffoonish behavior and his serial falsehoods   and count themselves as endangered heroes for the effort.FOILS FOR TRUMPIronically, though, these pompous journalists gave Trump what was arguably his best moment in his first 100 days by serving as foils for the President as he traveled to Harrisburg, Pennsylvania, on Saturday and basked in the adulation of blue-collar Americans who view the mainstream media as just one more appendage of a corrupt ruling elite.Breaking with tradition by snubbing the annual press gala, Trump delighted the Harrisburg crowd by saying:  A large group of Hollywood celebrities and Washington media are consoling each other in a hotel ballroom  and adding:  I could not possibly be more thrilled than to be more than 100 miles away from [the] Washington swamp   with much, much better people.  The crowd booed references to the elites and cheered Trump s choice to be with the common folk.Trump s rejection of the dinner and his frequent criticism of the mainstream media brought a defensive response from Jeff Mason, president of the White House Correspondents  Association, who complained:  We are not fake news. We are not failing news organizations. And we are not the enemy of the American people.  That brought the black-tie-and-gown gathering to its feet in a standing ovation.Perhaps the assembled media elite had forgotten that it was the mainstream U.S. media   particularly The Washington Post and The New York Times   that popularized the phrase  fake news  and directed it blunderbuss-style not only at the few Web sites that intentionally invent stories to increase their clicks but at independent-minded journalism outlets that have dared question the elite s groupthinks on issues of war, peace and globalization.THE BLACK LISTProfessional journalistic skepticism toward official claims by the U.S. government   what you should expect from reporters   became conflated with  fake news.  The Post even gave front-page attention to an anonymous group called PropOrNot that published a black list of 200 Internet sites, including Consortiumnews.com and other independent-minded journalism sites, to be shunned.But the mainstream media stars didn t like it when Trump began throwing the  fake news  slur back at them. Thus, the First Amendment lapel pins and the standing ovation for Jeff Mason s repudiation of the  fake news  label.Yet, as the glitzy White House Correspondents Dinner demonstrated, mainstream journalists get the goodies of prestige and money while the real truth-tellers are almost always outspent, outgunned and cast out of the mainstream. Indeed, this dwindling band of honest people who are both knowledgeable and in position to expose unpleasant truths is often under mainstream attack, sometimes for unrelated personal failings and other times just for rubbing the powers-that-be the wrong way.Perhaps, the clearest case study of this up-is-down rewards-and-punishments reality was the Iraq War s WMD rationale. Nearly across the board, the American political/media system   from U.S. intelligence analysts to the deliberative body of the U.S. Senate to the major U.S. news organizations   failed to ascertain the truth and indeed actively helped disseminate the falsehoods about Iraq hiding WMDs and even suggested nuclear weapons development. (Arguably, the  most trusted  U.S. government official at the time, Secretary of State Colin Powell, played a key role in selling the false allegations as  truth. )Not only did the supposed American  gold standard  for assessing information   the U.S. political, media and intelligence structure   fail miserably in the face of fraudulent claims often from self-interested Iraqi opposition figures and their neoconservative American backers, but there was minimal accountability afterwards for the  professionals  who failed to protect the public from lies and deceptions.PROFITING FROM FAILUREIndeed, many of the main culprits remain  respected  members of the journalistic establishment. For instance, The New York Times  Pentagon correspondent Michael R. Gordon, who was the lead writer on the infamous  aluminum tubes for nuclear centrifuges  story which got the ball rolling for the Bush administration s rollout of its invade-Iraq advertising campaign in September 2002, still covers national security for the Times   and still serves as a conveyor belt for U.S. government propaganda.The Washington Post s editorial page editor Fred Hiatt, who repeatedly informed the Post s readers that Iraq s secret possession of WMD was a  flat-fact,  is still the Post s editorial page editor, one of the most influential positions in American journalism.Hiatt s editorial page led a years-long assault on the character of former U.S. Ambassador Joseph Wilson for the offense of debunking one of President George W. Bush s claims about Iraq seeking yellowcake uranium from Niger. Wilson had alerted the CIA to the bogus claim before the invasion of Iraq and went public with the news afterwards, but the Post treated Wilson as the real culprit, dismissing him as  a blowhard  and trivializing the Bush administration s destruction of his wife s CIA career by outing her (Valerie Plame) in order to discredit Wilson s Niger investigation.At the end of the Post s savaging of Wilson s reputation and in the wake of the newspaper s accessory role in destroying Plame s career, Wilson and Plame decamped from Washington to New Mexico. Meanwhile, Hiatt never suffered a whit   and remains a  respected  Washington media figure to this day.CAREERIST LESSONThe lesson that any careerist would draw from the Iraq case is that there is almost no downside risk in running with the pack on a national security issue. Even if you re horrifically wrong   even if you contribute to the deaths of some 4,500 U.S. soldiers and hundreds of thousands of Iraqis   your paycheck is almost surely safe.The same holds true if you work for an international agency that is responsible for monitoring issues like chemical weapons. Again, the Iraq example offers a good case study. In April 2002, as President Bush was clearing away the few obstacles to his Iraq invasion plans, Jose Mauricio Bustani, the head of the Organization for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons [OPCW], sought to persuade Iraq to join the Chemical Weapons Convention so inspectors could verify Iraq s claims that it had destroyed its stockpiles.The Bush administration called that idea an  ill-considered initiative    after all, it could have stripped away the preferred propaganda rationale for the invasion if the OPCW verified that Iraq had destroyed its chemical weapons. So, Bush s Undersecretary of State for Arms Control John Bolton, a neocon advocate for the invasion of Iraq, pushed to have Bustani deposed. The Bush administration threatened to withhold dues to the OPCW if Bustani, a Brazilian diplomat, remained.It now appears obvious that Bush and Bolton viewed Bustani s real offense as interfering with their invasion scheme, but Bustani was ultimately taken down over accusations of mismanagement, although he was only a year into a new five-year term after having been reelected unanimously. The OPCW member states chose to sacrifice Bustani to save the organization from the loss of U.S. funds, but   in so doing   they compromised its integrity, making it just another agency that would bend to big-power pressure. By dismissing me,  Bustani said,  an international precedent will have been established whereby any duly elected head of any international organization would at any point during his or her tenure remain vulnerable to the whims of one or a few major contributors.  He added that if the United States succeeded in removing him,  genuine multilateralism  would succumb to  unilateralism in a multilateral disguise Continue this report at Consortium News READ MORE US NEWS AT: 21st Century Wire US FilesSUPPORT OUR WORK BY SUBSCRIBING & BECOMING A MEMBER @21WIRE.TV",1,en

"As Syria cease-fire fails, Obama may leave successor 'problem from hell'. WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The United States was relegated to the sidelines of the Syrian war on Friday as an all-out assault by Syrian government and Russian forces on opposition-held Aleppo threatened to unleash a new refugee wave and drive U.S.-backed rebels into the ranks of al Qaeda’s Syrian branch, U.S. officials and experts said. Moscow’s direct participation in the offensive left fading hope for U.S.-Russian peace efforts, raising the likelihood that U.S. President Barack Obama’s successor will inherit a worsening conflict. Entering its sixth year, the Syrian civil war already has left some 250,000 people dead, uprooted more than 11 million and provided a base for Islamic State to launch and inspire attacks in the West. “For the next president on Day One, this becomes the problem from hell,” said Frederic Hof, a former Obama adviser on Syria who is now at the Atlantic Council think tank. “It’s a problem that’s going to persist in one way or another throughout the first term of the next president and probably beyond.” A U.S. official suggested White House plans to keep Syrian chaos under control as Obama leaves office have been upended. “It was hoped that they could turn over a simmering mess to the next president,” said a U.S. official. “But what happened was that the simmering mess blew up and now they are going to have to figure out what to do.” U.S. officials, speaking on condition of anonymity, said that Russian aircraft, long-range artillery and special forces advisers were directly participating with Syrian government forces in the drive to conquer eastern Aleppo, the largest urban stronghold of the U.S.-backed moderate opposition. Shiite militiamen from Lebanon, Iraq and Afghanistan also were involved in the assault on the devastated enclave, where an estimated 250,000 civilians were suffering the most intense airstrikes of the war, they said. “The Russians are actively participating in the current offensive in Aleppo,” said one U.S. official. “It appears to be a no-holds barred attempt to crush the opposition.”  Russian aircraft were flying sorties at the same rate – about 40 per day - as they were before Washington and Moscow negotiated a failed ceasefire between the Syria government and opposition forces in February, the officials said. Some U.S. intelligence officials believe that Russian President Vladimir Putin is taking advantage of Obama’s refusal to intervene militarily in Syria and his lame duck status to seize as much territory as possible before the new U.S. president takes office. These officials argue that Russia has not sincerely engaged in peace-making efforts and that Putin aims to weaken the opposition as rapidly as possible, a goal in which he is gradually succeeding. Damascus announced the offensive on Thursday as Secretary of State John Kerry and Russian counterpart Sergei Lavrov failed to salvage a ceasefire that collapsed on Monday. The ceasefire was supposed to lead to U.S.-Russian cooperation on airstrikes against Islamic State and al Qaeda’s Syrian affiliate, formerly known as the Nusra Front. What course Obama will now take remained unclear. “There doesn’t seem to be a Plan B right now,” Hof said. Obama has sought to restrict U.S. involvement in Syria, repeatedly rejecting proposals by advisers for actions such as establishing a no-fly zone or arming the moderate opposition fighting to topple President Bashar Assad. “One of the things that haunts me the most was our failure to ask ourselves about the consequences of inaction,” said one former senior official involved in Syria policy. “We were always focused on the consequences of action ... But we should have also considered how doing nothing for several years might have an impact on U.S. credibility and the conflict more broadly.” Obama has limited the U.S. role to supporting groups fighting Islamic State in northeastern Syria. He has pursued  talks with Russia, which intervened on Assad’s behalf in September 2015, on a peace accord between U.S.-backed moderate rebels and Damascus. Obama, however, no longer can count on securing a ceasefire that will keep a lid on the crisis until his successor is sworn-in on Jan. 20, experts said. Charles Lister of the Middle East Institute think tank said he doubted that Obama would adopt a more robust policy. “Given the posture the Obama administration has developed with regards to how it faces the war in Syria, I don’t see it shifting the strategy,” he said. “That would be the most extraordinary foreign policy shift in the last eight years.” Obama, however, faces the prospect of a deepening humanitarian disaster, officials and experts said. The fall of Aleppo could unleash a new wave of migrants fleeing toward Europe, which has been struggling since last year to accommodate more than 1 million refugees. Moreover, U.S.-backed rebels, dismayed over what they saw as Obama’s abandonment of Aleppo, could begin joining al Qaeda’s Syrian branch. It is widely regarded as the most effective opposition group and has vehemently rejected a negotiated settlement with Assad, U.S. officials and experts said. Lister, who maintains contacts with rebels inside Syria, said opposition leaders are growing disillusioned with U.S. efforts to negotiate a diplomatic solution with Assad’s main military backer. “Things are deteriorating so quickly now. The U.S. is losing leverage on the ground every week,” he said.      ",0,en

"[VIDEO] 16 YR OLD ARRESTED For Violent Gang Beating In McDonalds…15 Yr Old Victim Brags About New Found Fame. This is a sad commentary on a generation who has truly lost their moral compass. No self respect, dignity or pride  It s all about the 15 seconds of fame While we have yet to fathom how for almost three minutes, no one not even an adult or an employee stopped a now infamous fight inside a Brooklyn McDonald s. So far, one arrest has been made. Sixteen-year-old Aniah Ferguson was one of six girls who attacked 15-year-old Ariana Taylor and it seemed every teenager inside the McDonald s was there to witness the violent carnage, for which they also captured cell phone video.The 15-year-old did her best to hold her own in the brawl, which was allegedly arranged via Facebook. New York Daily News is reporting that Taylor has taken to Facebook to brag about her new-found fame. A user named Richey Bandz commented on Taylor s social media, saying,  I applaud u shorty u a ICON NOW,  and Taylor responded,  Thanks guys.  And that s when another user, Marshonna Espinosa said,  So sad this little girl think she s getting famous for getting publicly humiliated. No, you re not famous. People felt bad for you.  We re not so sure NY Daily News and Marshonna s assumptions around Taylor thinking she s famous are anything but assumptions. When Taylor posted a photo of herself, not to beat up, with the caption,  I m Gucci,  we took it as her addressing the concerned public and letting us all know she s good.Reports claim that Ferguson had been hunting Taylor down since January for some undisclosed disagreement involving a friend. She suffered injuries and was taken to Kings County Hospital that same night. But once the video was shared massively online, and even covered the front page of the New York Post and Daily News (though their known for exploiting situations like this), moves were made to find the girls who are also students of Erasmus Hall High School. Even for a World Star Hip-Hop era, the clip shocked most who viewed it. The 15-year-old was literally a punching and kicking bag.***Warning**** This video contains extreme violence:After Ferguson s arrest yesterday, her criminal record leaked and she has a history of violence at only 16. Before, she was arrested for stabbing her brother and assaulting her grandmother, who had to take an order of protection against her grandchild. She s had a total of nine arrests, six of them have been since September. Ferguson is unfortunately epitomizing the image and lifestyle of troubled youth. From her latest felony, she s being charged as an adult. Obviously there s a bigger story here around teenagers like Ferguson who come from troubled pasts and bring that into their present lives, allowing nothing but violence to speak for them.Via: Hello Beautiful",1,en

Do you think for one minute that Trump would have gotten where he is if he d not reached out to people and built bridges literally and figuratively? The reason Trump wants to build a literal wall with Mexico is that,  without borders, we don t have a country . We can certainly reach out to others but Trump knows open borders DO NOT WORK! Just take a look at Europe and the EU! What a mess! Trump has said he wants LEGAL IMMIGRATION and doesn t want ILLEGAL IMMIGRATION! He s protecting the people of America and that s putting America first!The problem with Billy Crystal s swipe at Trump is that he isn t practicing what he preaches. Anyone who knows Los Angeles knows that the homes have gates and walls. Well, Billy Crystal has walls and a fence surrounding his home people in glass houses!It was easy to get photos above of the fence and wall around Billy Crystal s home but we can t just walk onto his property uninvited. Isn t that the same as people walking over our border illegally?Comedian Billy Crystal gave an emotional tribute during Muhammad Ali s funeral on Friday, but may have sneaked in a low-key dig at Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump. Crystal, a friend of The Champ s for more than 40 years, said at the end of his eulogy for the boxer in the KFC Yum! Center in Louisville, Kentucky that Ali  taught us that life is best when you build bridges between people, not walls.  That line Crystal said sounds similar to what Hillary Clinton said during her victory speech on Tuesday.  We believe that cooperation is better than conflict, unity is better than division, empowerment is better than resentment, and bridges are better than walls,  the Democratic presidential candidate front-runner said.

"Emirates changes pilot, crew rosters on US flights after Trump order. DUBAI (Reuters) - Emirates airline has changed pilot and flight attendant rosters  on flights to the United States following the sudden U.S. travel ban on seven Muslim-majority countries, highlighting the challenges facing airlines trying to deal with the new rules. The world’s largest long-haul carrier, which flies daily to 11 U.S. cities, has made “the necessary adjustments to our crewing, to comply with the latest requirements,” an Emirates spokeswoman told Reuters by email on Sunday. She added U.S. flights continue to operate to schedule. President Donald Trump on Friday suspended the entry of people from Iran, Iraq, Libya, Somalia, Sudan, Syria and Yemen. The decision caught airlines off guard, according to the International Air Transport Association. “I cannot think of anything comparable. This brings a mix of administrative confusion, impact and uncertainty for many travelers as well as practical operational headaches and complexities for airlines in planning their flight programs,” independent aviation consultant John Strickland told Reuters. The ban applies to pilots and flight attendants from the seven countries, even though all flight crew who are not U.S. citizens already need a special visa to enter the country.  Nicoley Baublies, from the German cabin crew union UFO, said the move was very unusual and meant uncertainty for airlines in terms of planning. “Lufthansa has always ensured it has very diverse crews, with staff of different nationalities and that means that we are for the first time in decades having to look at where people come from,” he told Reuters at Frankfurt airport. A spokesman for Lufthansa said on Sunday it was too early to comment on the effects of the order but that airlines and passengers were required to follow the new rules. Another Emirates spokeswoman said the impact of the ban on operations would be minimal. The airline employs over 23,000 flight attendants and about 4,000 pilots from around the world, including the United States, Europe and the Middle East. Meanwhile, a spokesman for Etihad Airways of Abu Dhabi said the airline had “taken steps to ensure there will be no issues for flights departing over the coming weeks.” Japan Airlines (9201.T) (JAL) on Monday said it had begun screening passengers from the countries affected Trump’s travel ban before their departure for the United States. JAL officials would contact the U.S. Customs and Border Protection agency to confirm whether passengers would be allowed entry, a spokesman for Japan’s second-biggest carrier said.      It is unclear if the ban applies to dual nationals - those who hold one passport from a country on the list and another from a non-U.S. country that is not. Etihad said on its website that dual citizens could travel to the U.S. using their non-banned passport. IATA have told its members that the ban does not apply to dual nationals if they have a passport not on the list, according to an email seen by Reuters. However, the Guardian reported on Saturday, quoting State Department officials, that dual nationals were banned. US officials said on Sunday holders of green cards need to check with a U.S. consulate and will be cleared on a case by case basis. On Sunday, IATA sent another email to member airlines, seen by Reuters, asking for examples of Green Card holders being denied boarding. It also said it was seeking more information from authorities in Washington. Baublies said the uncertainty over the rules was not helping. “Trump reacts in 140 characters, we don’t know what it means - for people with the wrong entries in their passports or with dual nationality or married to someone from one of the countries affected, are they allowed to travel?” There are also concerns the restrictions could dampen travel demand.  “Ultimately this could feed through to the role airlines play in the global economy in supporting business and tourism due to as yet unquantifiable impacts on demand & cost,” Strickland said. Baublies said airlines were usually among the first affected by global crises. “We hope it doesn’t mean that seats are left empty because people don’t know where they can travel with which passport.” Dubai-based Emirates and Etihad Airways are both owned by the governments of the United Arab Emirates, a U.S. ally and Muslim-majority country. Both carriers said they would continue to comply with the new rules on U.S. immigration but where possible would offer to refund or re-book affected passengers. Emirates and Etihad have also said that passengers were affected by the ban over the weekend but their flight crews had not been impacted. Qatar Airways declined to comment on the impact of the ban on flight operations, although on Saturday it issued a statement on its website that passengers would need a green card or diplomatic visa to enter the U.S. Emirates and Etihad issued similar statements.

"Factbox: Catalonia crisis - What's next?. MADRID (Reuters) - Catalonia s ousted leader Carles Puigdemont agreed on Tuesday to a snap election called by Spain s central government when it took control of the region to stop it breaking away, but he said the fight for independence would go on. Below are several scenarios of what could happen in the next few days. Puigdemont and his sacked cabinet have been ordered to testify before the Spanish High Court on Thursday and Friday after charges of rebellion, sedition and breach of trust were filed against them. Under Spain s legal system, a judge will then decide whether Puigdemont should go to jail pending a investigation that can sometimes take up to several years - and a potential trial. Puigdemont traveled to Brussels after the Catalan regional parliament issued a unilateral declaration of independence on Friday, and it was not immediately clear whether he would heed the call to appear before the court. He had said earlier on Tuesday he would return to Spain only when given unspecified  guarantees  by the Spanish government.  The same charges have been drawn up against the Catalan parliament s speaker, Carme Forcadell, and other senior lawmakers but, given they have parliamentary immunity, they will testify before the Supreme Court, which is in charge of handling cases relating to lawmakers or members of the government. Prosecutors have asked the courts to order Catalan secessionist leaders to deposit 6.2 million euros to cover potential liabilities but they have not sought preventive jail against them. This could change however if Puigdemont and his associates did not show up at the High Court as the judge could deem them to be a flight risk and jail them. It is not clear whether a snap regional election will resolve the crisis. Two recent opinion polls showed support for independence may have started to wane.  But an official regional survey published on Tuesday showed some 48.7 percent of Catalans believe the region should be independent, up from 41.1 pct in June and the highest since December 2014.  Based on 1,338 interviews, the Centre d Estudis d Opinio poll was the first survey released since the independence declaration though the bulk of it was taken before then, between Oct. 16 and Oct. 29. Other opinion polls have also shown Catalonia is almost evenly split between pro- and anti-independence supporters. One key thing to watch will be if pro-independence parties run on a joint ticket or on separate platforms. If they ran separately, they could find it more difficult to reach a parliamentary majority. They must say whether they intend to run together before Nov. 7 and then put forward their candidates by Nov. 18. Prime Minister Mariano Rajoy sacked Catalonia s government including Puigdemont and his deputy Oriol Junqueras and assumed direct control over the region. Central government ministries assumed the powers of the Catalan administration until a regional election takes place on Dec. 21. That unprecedented step was implemented smoothly and calls for civil disobedience were widely disregarded. ",0,en
"Democrats link U.S. debt limit vote to Republican tax cut moves. WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Democrats in the U.S. Congress warned on Tuesday that Republican moves to grant new tax breaks to the wealthy could jeopardize Democratic support for an increase in the government’s borrowing authority later this year. “If they’re (Republicans) going to put on the table a massive tax cut for the very wealthy that increases the deficit by trillions (of dollars), it’s harder to get Democrats to increase the debt ceiling,” Senate Democratic leader Chuck Schumer told reporters. A healthcare reform bill passed by the House of Representatives contains a tax cut for the wealthy, and a major tax reform initiative by Republicans this year could contain additional reductions.

"China says one step forwards, two steps back no good for Japan ties. BEIJING (Reuters) - China s foreign minister on Thursday said that ties with Japan should not take two steps back for every step forward, after Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe made a rare appearance at an anniversary event for the normalization of diplomatic relations. Speaking on the eve of the 45th anniversary of the resumption of ties between Beijing and Tokyo, Foreign Minister Wang Yi told Japan s ambassador to China, Yutaka Yokoi, that he hoped for greater improvement in relations.  We hope that the Japanese government can pursue a more positive policy towards China... and not take one step back for each step forward, even two steps back for each step forward,  Wang said, according to a statement released on the ministry website on Friday. Relations have been complicated for decades by the legacy of Japan s wartime aggression, as well as by a festering territorial dispute in the East China Sea. Abe on Thursday evening made an appearance at a Chinese embassy event in Tokyo that jointly celebrated the anniversary as well as China s Oct 1 National Day. Wang called the appearance  good news  and added:  We hope for more good news in China-Japan relations and not for bad news to follow shortly after good news.  Chinese Premier Li Keqiang and Abe also exchanged congratulatory messages on Friday, in which Li said that the two countries should  properly manage and control their contradictions and differences , China s official Xinhua news agency reported.  Japan s cabinet on Thursday announced Oct. 22 as the date of a snap election where Abe, a conservative who returned to power in 2012, hopes a recent boost in voter support will help his Liberal Democratic Party-led coalition maintain a simple majority. It now holds a two-thirds  super  majority. ",0,en

"WATCH: MSNBC’S HATE-FILLED LIBERAL Host Chris Matthews Makes Joke About President Trump Assassinating His Son-In-Law…No Media Outrage. RCP   In just a few minutes on Thursday s edition of  Hardball  on MSNBC, host Chris Matthews compared President Trump and his family to Saddam Hussein and his sons, the Ethiopian dictator Mengistu Haile Mariam, Italian fascist Benito Mussolini, and the deposed Russian royal family, the Romanovs.Here s a portion of the transcript:MATTHEWS: Is it a royal family instead of a Democratic or a Republican form of government? Or is it a family running the government? Is it Ivanka and Jared and the President sitting around in the White House upstairs ruling the world?ASHLEY PARKER: I don t think it s quite that but I think it is run like a family business. The president and his aides see it publicly and privately and the President s family, his children, especially his daughter Ivanka and, you know, Jared Kushner, they operate with a degree of impunity that does not exist for these other aides. So, if you look at just Jared and Tillerson, Jared basically emerged as a shadow Secretary of State. You mentioned peace in the Middle East. His portfolio includes not only that, it includes China, it includes Mexico, it includes Canada and that s just on the foreign policy front. So, if you re the secretary of state, ambassadors and leaders of foreign nations know that they can directly go to the President s son-in-law and have his ear that deeply undermines you and makes it really difficult for you to do your job.MATTHEWS: And then you find out in all these investigations that Jared was opening up a tunnel to Moscow so he wouldn t have to deal with the State Department. So the son-in-law   you know, one good thing Mussolini did was execute his son-in-law. I mean, I m talking about CianoFRANK BRUNI: Let s be careful here, yeah.Much like the vile and repulsive comments made by other leftists in the media or in Hollywood, Matthews disgusting remarks will be completely ignored by the media, as this type of hateful rhetoric has been deemed perfectly acceptable by their peers, as long as the hate is directed at President Trump, his family or his supporters, everything is fair game ",1,en

" Paul Ryan Sharpens His Backstabbing Knife, Prepares War With White House (VIDEO). During Donald Trump s meltdown during his rally in Phoenix Tuesday evening, he threatened to shut down the government unless Congress funds his border wall. The former reality show star launched a rant which was so insane that people are starting to question whether he s fit to hold office. We re pretty sure that House Speaker Paul Ryan is wondering that, too, after Trump s screamy-ragey speech.On Wednesday, House Speaker Paul Ryan (R-WI) said he doesn t  think a government shutdown is necessary,  however, we ve noticed that when the Republican leader says something in stark contrast to Trump s rhetoric, he never says it to his face. Like, for example, when he tweeted his denouncement of the Nazis who marched in Trump s name in Charlottesville, Virginia, with one of them murdering Heather Heyer, 32, and injuring 19 others, he failed to tag @RealDonaldTrump.But anyway, Ryan said during a press conference in Hillsboro, Oregon,  I don t think a government shutdown is necessary, and I don t think most people want to see a government shutdown, ourselves included. Ryan continued to say that  Congress in the House has already done its work on this issue  and left it up to the Senate. Given the time of year it is, and the rest of the appropriations we have to do, we re going to need more time to complete our appropriations process, particularly in the Senate,  he said.Talking Points Memo reports:Trump on Tuesday night suggested he would push to tie funding for his proposed border wall to a government spending bill Congress must pass in the fall to avert a shutdown. I don t think anyone s interested in having a shutdown. I don t think it s in our interest to do so,  Ryan added.  I don t think you have to choose between the two. Watch:.@SpeakerRyan: ""I don't think a government shut down is necessary, and I don't think most people want to see"" one. https://t.co/9ZBdrCglu6 pic.twitter.com/ClqY5NAABp  This Week (@ThisWeekABC) August 23, 2017Perhaps Ryan should have  a sit down with Trump and explain to him what happens during a government shutdown. On the other hand, Trump doesn t seem to care about very much. Ryan is trying to distance himself from the very president he supports. He s playing it safe, knowing full well that Trump won t last much longer in office. Ryan wants to come out of the madness with his hands clean so he can say,  Hey, I called Trump out  without actually calling him out. That said, he s going to have a battle on his hands to keep the government open and it looks like he s ready for that. We re certain several of his Republican colleagues would back him up on that.Image via screen capture. ",1,en

"Comey had pushed for more resources for Russia probe before being fired by Trump: source. WASHINGTON (Reuters) - FBI Director James Comey, days before President Donald Trump fired him, told lawmakers he sought more resources for his agency’s probe into possible collusion between Trump’s presidential campaign and Russia to sway the 2016 U.S. election, a congressional source said on Wednesday. With the Republican president facing a storm of criticism from many Democratic lawmakers and some in his own party, the Trump administration accused Comey of “atrocities” on the job and denied his firing was related to the FBI’s Russia investigation. Trump, who met Russia’s foreign minister at the White House on Wednesday, lashed out at critics, calling Democrats “phony hypocrites,” and defended his decision to abruptly oust Comey on Tuesday from the law enforcement post he held since 2013. In a farewell letter to staff seen by CNN, Comey, who was appointed by Trump’s predecessor, Democratic President Barack Obama, said he had “long believed that a president can fire an FBI director for any reason, or for no reason at all.” Comey added he would not spend time dwelling on Trump’s decision “or the way it was executed.” But Democrats ramped up accusations that Comey’s removal was intended to undermine the Federal Bureau of Investigation probe and demanded an independent investigation into the alleged Russian meddling, with some calling the firing an attempt to cover up wrongdoing related to Russia. A congressional source with knowledge of the matter said Comey told lawmakers within the past few days he had asked the Justice Department to make additional resources available - mainly more staffing - for the Russia probe. Comey informed lawmakers of that request after the Senate Intelligence Committee, conducting its own investigation, had asked the FBI to speed up its Russia inquiry, the source said. Democrat Dianne Feinstein, the Senate Judiciary Committee’s top Democrat, told reporters she understood Comey was seeking more resources for the FBI investigation. Responding to media reports that Comey had asked Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein last week for a significant boost in resources for the agency’s probe, Justice Department spokesman Ian Prior said in an email: “Totally false.” U.S. intelligence agencies concluded in a January report that Russian President Vladimir Putin had ordered an effort to disrupt the 2016 election that included hacking into Democratic Party emails and leaking them, with the aim of helping Trump. Russia has denied any such meddling. The Trump administration denies allegations of collusion with Russia. Top U.S. Republicans rallied to Trump’s defense, but some called the action troubling. Republican House Oversight Committee Chairman Jason Chaffetz said in a statement on Wednesday he had requested a review by the Department of Justice’s inspector general of Trump’s decision to fire Comey, who had more than six years left in his 10-year post. Comey’s dismissal stunned Washington and plunged Trump deeper into a controversy over his campaign’s alleged ties with Russia that has dogged the early days of his presidency, while also threatening to hinder his policy goals. “He wasn’t doing a good job, very simply,” the Republican president said of Comey during a meeting with former Secretary of State Henry Kissinger in the White House Oval Office. The administration said on Tuesday that Comey’s firing stemmed from his handling of an election-year FBI probe into Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton’s use of a private email server during her time as secretary of state. White House officials said Trump’s anger at Comey had been building for months but a turning point came when the FBI chief refused to preview for top Trump aides his planned testimony to a May 3 Senate hearing on the Clinton email issue, an act Trump and his aides took it as an act of insubordination. Trump had been considering letting Comey go “since the day he was elected” in November, White House spokeswoman Sarah Huckabee Sanders said. She referred to what she called Comey’s “atrocities in circumventing the chain of command” at the Justice Department. Many Democrats have criticized Comey’s management of the Clinton investigation, but they questioned the timing of his dismissal, given that Trump could have acted soon after taking office on Jan. 20 and that he has repeatedly criticized the FBI and congressional probes into Russia’s role in the election. In a flurry of Twitter posts, Trump said Comey had “lost the confidence of almost everyone in Washington, Republican and Democrat alike.” He added, “Dems have been complaining for months & months about Dir. Comey. Now that he has been fired they PRETEND to be aggrieved. Phony hypocrites!” The Senate minority leader, Democrat Chuck Schumer, said Rosenstein should appoint a special prosecutor. Schumer called on Republican Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell to hold closed and potentially classified briefings with all senators to question the top Justice Department officials, Attorney General Jeff Sessions and Rosenstein. “We know Director Comey was leading an investigation (into) whether the Trump campaign colluded with the Russians, a serious offense. Were those investigations getting too close to home for the president?” Schumer said. McConnell accused Democrats of “complaining about the removal of an FBI director who they themselves repeatedly and sharply criticized” and said a special prosecutor would impede existing probes like one under way in the Senate Intelligence Committee. Paul Ryan, the Republican leader of the House of Representatives, told Fox News in an interview it was “entirely within the president’s role and authority” to remove Comey and that a special prosecutor was unnecessary. Mark Warner, the intelligence committee’s top Democrat, said he and the panel’s Republican chairman, Richard Burr, had asked Comey to testify before the panel in private next Tuesday. On Wednesday evening, the intelligence panel said it had issued a subpoena requesting documents from Trump’s former national security adviser, Michael Flynn, in relation to its Russia probe. The committee said it had first requested the documents in a letter to Flynn on April 28. Flynn was forced to resign in February for failing to disclose the content of his talks with Sergei Kislyak, Russia’s ambassador to the United States, and then misleading Vice President Mike Pence about the conversations.  Trump said he had “a very, very good meeting” with Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov and they discussed Syria’s civil war. Their meeting was the highest-level public contact between Trump and Putin’s government since Trump took office.  During an earlier appearance at the State Department, Lavrov responded in a sarcastic tone when asked about Comey’s dismissal, saying: “Was he fired? You’re kidding. You’re kidding.” In the Russian city of Sochi, Putin said Comey’s firing would not have an impact on U.S.-Russian relations. Trump’s nominee as the new FBI director would need to win Senate confirmation. Trump’s possible choices to head the FBI on an interim basis, according to a White House official, include acting FBI Director Andrew McCabe, Assistant Director Paul Abbate, Chicago FBI agent Michael Anderson and Richmond, Virginia, agent Adam Lee.

"Iranian commander issued stark warning to Iraqi Kurds over Kirkuk. SULAIMANIA/BAGHDAD (Reuters) - A senior Iranian military commander repeatedly warned Kurdish leaders in northern Iraq to withdraw from the oil city of Kirkuk or face an onslaught by Iraqi forces and allied Iranian-backed fighters, Kurdish officials briefed on the meetings said. Major-General Qassem Soleimani, commander of foreign operations for Iran s elite Revolutionary Guards, traveled to Iraq s Kurdistan region to meet Kurdish leaders at least three times this month before the Baghdad government s lightning campaign to recapture territory across the north. The presence of Soleimani on the frontlines highlights Tehran s heavy sway over policy in Iraq, and comes as Shi ite Iran seeks to win a proxy war in the Middle East with its regional rival and U.S. ally, Sunni Saudi Arabia. Soleimani met leaders from the Patriotic Union of Kurdistan (PUK), one of the two main Kurdish political parties in northern Iraq, in the city of Sulaimania the day before Iraqi Prime Minister Haider al-Abadi ordered his forces to advance on Kirkuk, according to a PUK lawmaker briefed on the meeting. His message was clear: withdraw or risk losing Tehran as a strategic ally.  Abadi has all the regional powers and the West behind him and nothing will stop him from forcing you to return back to the mountains if he decides so,  the lawmaker quoted Soleimani as telling the PUK leadership.  The Iranian general evoked late Iraqi president Saddam Hussein s massive attack on a Kurdish rebellion in 1991, when almost the entire Kurdish population fled northern Iraq to the mountains, the PUK lawmaker said.  Soleimani s visit ... was to give a last-minute chance for the decision-makers not to commit a fatal mistake,  said the lawmaker, who like others interviewed in this story declined to be identified because of the sensitivity of the issue. Commanders of the Iraqi Kurdish forces, known as the Peshmerga, have accused Iran of orchestrating the Shi ite-led Iraqi central government s push into areas under their control, a charge senior Iranian officials have denied. But Iran has made no secret of its presence in Iraq.  Tehran s military help is not a secret anymore. You can find General Soleimani s pictures in Iraq everywhere,  said an official close to Iranian President Hassan Rouhani.  Now, beside political issues, Kirkuk s oil is a very key element for Iran, which is an OPEC member. Control of those oil fields by Iran s enemies would be disastrous for us. Why should we let them enter the oil market?.  Kirkuk fell to Iraqi government forces on Monday. Their offensive followed a referendum last month in which the semi-autonomous Kurdistan region voted to secede from Iraq against Baghdad s wishes. Kurds have sought an independent state for almost a century, after colonial powers divided up the Middle East after the fall of the Ottoman Empire and left Kurdish-populated territory split between Turkey, Iran, Iraq and Syria. But Iraq s two main Kurdish parties have been at odds over both the referendum and the approach to the crisis in Kirkuk, which the Kurds consider to be the heart of their homeland. The PUK, a close ally of Iran, accused its rival, the Kurdistan Democratic Party (KDP), of putting the Kurds at risk of military intervention and isolation by pushing hard for the vote, which won wide approval for independence. Soleimani has been allied to the PUK for years, but the referendum has drawn him even closer to Kurdish politics and expanded Iran s reach in Iraq beyond the Baghdad government. The Iranian general is no stranger to conflicts in Iraq, which fought an eight-year war with Iran in the 1980s. He has often been seen in footage from the frontlines, and Iran has long helped Baghdad to carry out its military strategy through paramilitary Shi ite militias which it funds and arms. Before the referendum, Soleimani suggested to Kurdish leaders that holding a vote on secession   which Iran feared would encourage its own Kurdish population to agitate for greater autonomy   would be risky.  The Iranians were very clear. They have been very clear that there will be conflict, that these territories will be lost,  said one prominent Iraqi Kurdish politician who met Soleimani ahead of the Sept. 25 referendum.  On Oct. 6, barely a week after the vote, Soleimani attended the funeral of PUK leader Jalal Talabani. Again, he wanted to make sure even his closest Kurdish allies understood the dangers of not withdrawing from Kirkuk, officials said. A senior Iranian diplomat in Iraq and an official in Iran close to Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei s office said Soleimani met with Kurdish leaders after Talibani s funeral and urged them to withdraw from Kirkuk and in exchange Tehran would protect their interests.    Soleimani met with one of Talabani s sons, Bafel, a few days after his father was buried, one of the PUK officials said.  Soleimani said Abadi should be taken very seriously. You should understand this,  the official said. An Iranian source in Iraq said Soleimani was in Kirkuk two nights before the Iraqi government offensive for  a couple of hours to give military guidance.  Iraqi intelligence sources said Tehran sent a clear signal to the PUK.   We understand from our sources on the ground that neighboring Iran played a decisive role in making the PUK chose the right course with Baghdad,  one Iraqi intelligence official told Reuters. Tensions over the referendum and Kirkuk have deepened divisions between the two main political parties in northern Iraq. The KDP accused the PUK of betraying the Kurdish cause by capitulating to Iran and striking a deal to withdraw.  The Talabani clan were behind the offensive on Kirkuk. They asked Qassem (Soleimani) for help and his troops were there on the ground,  said a source close to Massoud Barzani, president of the Kurdistan Regional Government and head of the KDP.   It is becoming clear that Iran is directing the operations to destroy the KDP.  The PUK strongly denies this. Talabani s son Bafel accused the KDP of missing a zero-hour chance to avoid losing Kirkuk by failing to reach a deal over a military base which Iraqi government forces had demanded to take back.  Unfortunately we reacted too slowly. And we find ourselves where we are today,  Bafel told Reuters. Two other Kurdish political sources gave a similar account. Iran and Soleimani offered early assistance to northern Iraq s Kurds in the fight against Islamic State, a rallying point for the Kurdish community. But after the devastating loss of Kirkuk, Iraqi Kurds have been left disillusioned.  They (both PUK and KDP leaders) just make decisions on their own and play with people s lives. In the end, we pay the price,  said pensioner Abdullah Ahmed in Sulaimania.   This is a disaster for everyone. Everyone was united against Daesh (Islamic State). Now they are back just looking out for themselves.  ",0,en

" Trump SCREAMS On Twitter After Seeing A Poll On Fox News. Rex Tillerson was right. Donald Trump is a f*cking moron.After years of slamming polls as  fake,  Trump had the nerve to tout a poll on Sunday morning after Fox & Friends reported on it.The POLITICO/Morning Consult poll results show that 46 percent of respondents think the media fabricates stories about Trump.So, of course, the poll sent Trump to Twitter so he could literally scream about it and claim that his constant labeling of news outlets as  fake news  are  sinking through It is finally sinking through. 46% OF PEOPLE BELIEVE MAJOR NATIONAL NEWS ORGS FABRICATE STORIES ABOUT ME. FAKE NEWS, even worse! Lost cred.  Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) October 22, 2017Let s all keep in mind that this is ONE poll. Furthermore, the results were largely split down partisan lines, with 76 percent of Republicans believing that the news media make up stories about Trump. That number rises to 85 percent among Trump s most ardent supporters.If this poll had the opposite results, Trump would be dismissing it as a fake. And we all know it.Trump only thinks news stories and polls are accurate when they kiss his ass. That s why Fox & Friends is watched by Trump on a daily basis. They not only kiss his ass, they practically give him a blow-job every morning.Back in July, a PPP poll showed that a majority of Americans trust the news media more than they trust Trump.Over 50 percent of Americans said they trust NBC, CNN, ABC, the New York Times, and The Washington Post more than they trust Trump. The percentage of people who said they trust Trump more only hovered in the mid-30s.You know what else currently stands in the mid-30s? Trump s approval rating. The latest Gallup poll shows that only 35 percent of Americans approve of Trump s job performance. The Politico poll has it at 44 percent, so you can probably guess which poll Trump will call  fake.

"Multi-stage cyber attacks net North Korea millions in virtual currencies: researchers. SINGAPORE/SEOUL (Reuters) - A series of recent cyber attacks has netted North Korean hackers millions of dollars in virtual currencies like bitcoin, with more attacks expected as international sanctions drive the country to seek new sources of cash, researchers say. North Korea s government-backed hackers have been blamed for a rising number of cyber attacks, including the so-called WannaCry cyber attack that crippled hospitals, banks and other companies across the globe this year. Analysts say the explosive growth in the value of bitcoin makes it and other  cryptocurrencies  an attractive target for North Korea, which has become increasingly isolated under international sanctions imposed over its nuclear weapons and missile programs.  Bitcoin was trading at over $19,104 per bitcoin at one point on Tuesday, up from less than $1,000 at the beginning of 2017, according to Coinmarketcap.com.    Researchers in South Korea, which hosts some of the world s busiest virtual currency exchanges and accounts for 15 to 25 percent of world bitcoin trading on any given day, say attacks this year on exchanges like Bithumb, Coinis, and Youbit have the digital fingerprints of hackers from North Korea. The researchers  findings have not been independently verified. North Korea has rejected accusations that it has been involved in hacking. A spokesman for South Korea s Unification Ministry, which handles North Korean affairs, said on Monday the government was considering  countermeasures , including more sanctions, over the cyber attacks. Representatives of Bithumb and Coinis declined to comment. On Monday, a Youbit spokeswoman told Reuters the company had not been targeted by North Korean hackers, and on Tuesday the company announced it had suffered another cyber attack that cost it 17 percent of its assets, forcing the exchange to halt operations and file for bankruptcy. The hackers behind the second attack were not identified, but one cyber security researcher, who said he was not authorized to speak about the matter as it was being investigated, said there were similarities between the Youbit hack reported on Tuesday and the earlier attack on the company, which has been linked to North Korea. Another researcher, who worked with Youbit after the first hack in April, said the company has since experienced a consistent string of attacks that used malicious code previously used by North Korea. South Korea s intelligence service reported that some 7.6 billion won ($7 million) worth of cryptocurrencies were stolen in those previous attacks on multiple exchanges, according to South Korea s Chosun Ilbo newspaper. But that amount could now be worth about 90 billion Korean won ($82 million), Moonbeom Park, a researcher at the Korea Internet and Security Agency, told Reuters. Malicious code used in attacks over the summer was  virtually identical  to previous attacks connected to North Korea, he said. The attacks this year began by targeting the companies themselves, stealing customers  personal information, including names and email addresses, Park said. Some of those customers were then targeted with so-called spearphishing emails - infected emails designed to look as if they were from South Korea s taxation agency, the Korean National Tax Service, he said. Other researchers said the attackers had impersonated other official bodies. The emails told the recipient that the agency was about to conduct a tax investigation of the user.  An attached document, however, was a Korean-language file infected with a  Trojan Horse  program that would exploit a vulnerability in the Hanword Korean-language word processing software to allow the hackers to remotely control the user s computer, Park said. From there, the attackers would access the user s bitcoin wallet either on the computer, or on the bitcoin exchange s server, he said. Other researchers said the exchanges were also attacked using fake email accounts. Cristiana Brafman Kittner, principal analyst at the cybersecurity firm FireEye, said she could not confirm whether North Korea had actually stolen any virtual currencies, but said hackers linked to it had targeted  multiple exchanges  over the past six to nine months.  We believe that some of the criminal activity we are observing originating from North Korea is a result of the regime looking for alternative sources of revenue,  she said.  North Korean cyber threat actors present an immediate risk to the financial services sector worldwide.  ",0,en

"Tunisia's Chahed names new cabinet after tensions. TUNIS (Reuters) - Tunisia s prime minister named a new cabinet on Wednesday, appointing one of his advisors from the Islamist Ennahda party to a new economic reforms ministry in a deal that ends weeks of infighting over posts. The compromise cabinet should give Prime Minister Youssef Chahed the impetus to push ahead with tough reforms of public sector wages the pension system designed to improve Tunisia finances in line with IMF demands. Chahed, in power for just over a year, restored Ridha Chalgoum, a former finance minister close to the ruling Nidaa Tounes party, to that ministry. He also named Lotfi Braham, another Nidaa Tounes ally, as interior minister, according to a statement on the appointments released by Chahed s office. He also appointed Ennahda member Taoufik Rajhi, one of his economic advisors, to the new post of economic reforms minister,  Six years since the 2011 uprising that ousted autocrat Zine El-Abidine Ben Ali, Tunisia has been held up as a model by avoiding the violence that affected other nations after their  Arab Spring  revolts. However, successive governments have struggled to enact fiscal reforms that have been delayed by political infighting and government wariness of social tensions over jobs and economic conditions that helped spark the 2011 uprising. Nidaa Tounes allies were appointed to six of the 13 cabinet changes. Ennahda kept three posts and the new economics reforms portfolio. Nidaa Tounes hardliners had been pushing Chahed hard for more representation in the cabinet to better reward their 2014 election victory, while rivals in the power-sharing government pushed back. Ennahda said the party saw no reason for a major overhaul other than filling vacant minister posts. Political squabbling and Tunisia s compromise-style politics to maintain stability have in the past delayed economic reforms as parties jockey for position. This week the powerful UGTT labor union warned it could intervene as mediator, something it has done in past when tensions between secular Nidaa Tounes and Islamist Ennahda threatened to scuttle Tunisia s young democracy.  Chahed s deal with Nidaa Tounes and Ennahda is likely to ease tensions and to boost government stability,  said Riccardo Fabiani at Eurasia Group.   After scheduled local elections in December, this relationship is likely to gradually deteriorate again as tensions rise ahead of the 2019 presidential and legislative ballots,  he said. ",0,en

"Senate banking panel Democrats seek action on Obama nominees. (Reuters) - Senate Banking Committee Democrats on Monday asked the panel’s Republican chairman in a letter to “clear the backlog” of 16 nominations by President Barack Obama to posts related to financial oversight, national security and other areas. The committee, led by Republican Senator Richard Shelby, has “failed to carry out one of its basic duties” for more than a year, the 10 Democratic banking committee senators wrote in the Feb. 22 letter. It is the only Senate committee that did not act on any nominees last year, the Democrats wrote. Of the 16 nominations pending before the committee, four have been waiting for action for more than a year while others have been “in limbo” for more than nine months, the Democratic senators wrote. Shelby must “stop obstructing” the nominations, they wrote in a separate statement. All 10 Democrats on the committee signed the letter, including Senators Sherrod Brown of Ohio, Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts, and Charles Schumer of New York.  A spokeswoman for Shelby did not immediately respond to a request for comment. Shelby has said he is concerned that Obama has not nominated anyone as the U.S. Federal Reserve’s vice chair for supervision, a post created by the Dodd Frank financial reform law, but which has never been filled. “We are aware of your concern that the Administration has not nominated anyone to serve as Vice Chair for Supervision at the Federal Reserve, but the response to one vacancy should not be the creation of 16 more,” the Democratic banking committee senators wrote. It was unclear why President Obama has not appointed a nominee for the Fed post. A White House spokesperson was not immediately available for comment. The Senate Banking Committee backlog includes Lisa Fairfax and Hester Peirce, Obama’s two nominees to the Securities and Exchange Commission and Adam Szubin, nominated as the Treasury Department’s under secretary for terrorism and financial crimes.

"Armed force claims victory in Libyan migrant smuggling hub. TRIPOLI/TUNIS (Reuters) - An armed alliance involved in a three-week battle over the Libyan smuggling hub of Sabratha said it had taken control of the coastal city on Friday. A group called the Operations Room and its allies have been fighting the Anas al-Dabbashi brigade, a major facilitator of migrant smuggling that recently said it had changed tack and struck a deal with the U.N.-backed government in Tripoli to stop boats setting off across the Mediterranean.  Sabratha city has been liberated from the militias   the Dabbashi militias and their alliance,  said Operations Room spokesman Saleh Graisia.  Now the city is fully controlled by the Operations Room ... the militias have escaped to the west.  A senior member of the Dabbashi brigade confirmed that its men had retreated.  It is over,  he said in a message sent to Reuters.  They took over Sabratha.  The setback for the Dabbashi brigade creates new uncertainty over control of future migrant flows from Libya.       Since a 2016 deal between the EU and Turkey to block crossings in the Aegean, Libya has been the gateway for the vast majority of migrants trying to reach Europe by boat, and the area around Sabratha has been the most common departure point. From July, the number of crossings dropped sharply, a change attributed to increased activity by Libya s EU-trained coastguard and to the Dabbashi brigade blocking departures in return for offers of an amnesty and jobs in the security forces. The head of the Dabbashi brigade, Ahmed al-Dabbashi, said his men were then targeted by opponents who wanted to continue smuggling. Rivalries in Sabratha are also tied into overlapping political, ideological, tribal and economic differences. Both the Dabbashi brigade and the Operations Room, which was created last year to force Islamic State militants from Sabratha, have links to the U.N.-backed Government of National Accord (GNA). Since 2015, the Dabbashi brigade has guarded an oil and gas facility west of Sabratha run jointly by Libya s National Oil Corporation (NOC) and Italian firm Eni. Italian officials have visited Sabratha as part of efforts to block migrant flows from there. The Libyan National Army (LNA), which has opposed the GNA and is headed by prominent commander Khalifa Haftar, has also claimed ties to the Operations Room, leading to fears that the clashes in Sabratha could lead to a broader escalation of the conflict which developed in Libya after a 2011 uprising. The LNA is based in eastern Libya but is seeking to expand its reach in the west of the country. Milad al-Zawi, a spokesman for the LNA s special forces, said this week that around 40 of its soldiers had been fighting in Sabratha.    We hope that Sabratha is a good sign for the LNA,  he said on Friday. The GNA also welcomed developments in Sabratha, expressing  deep satisfaction  and claiming the Operations Room as its own. The fighting in Sabratha has left dozens dead and injured and has caused extensive damage to residential areas. The city s Roman ruins, which are a UNESCO world heritage site, have also been damaged.   Sabratha s municipal council appealed on Friday for displaced families not to return to their homes until they had been checked for explosives.  The military engineering unit is working to defuse booby traps inside the city,  said Operations Room spokesman Graisia. ",0,en

"U.S. partisan split widening over Russia probe: court documents. WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Top Democrats in the U.S. House of Representatives are refusing to endorse a Republican move to find out who paid the firm that commissioned a dossier alleging ties between Donald Trump’s presidential campaign and Russia, a court document made public on Monday showed. The split was the latest sign of partisan feuding that current and former U.S. officials say is undercutting a House Intelligence Committee probe into allegations of Russian interference in the 2016 presidential election. Republicans on the committee earlier this month subpoenaed an unidentified bank for the last two years of records of the accounts of Fusion GPS, the political research firm that hired former British intelligence officer Christopher Steele to pull together the dossier on Trump. The move was an apparent effort to find out who had paid for the work that led to the dossier. The firm assures its clients it will not disclose their identities. A source familiar with the situation said the law firm Perkins Coie had retained Fusion GPS on behalf of Democrat Hillary Clinton’s presidential campaign and the Democratic National Committee. “To aid in its representation of the Clinton presidential campaign and the Democratic National Committee, Perkins Coie retained Fusion GPS, entering into an engagement for research services that began in April 2016 and concluded before the election in early November,” the source said. Perkins Coie’s involvement in paying for the research was first reported by the Washington Post on Tuesday. Last week, Fusion GPS sued the unnamed bank in federal court in Washington, requesting a court order to block the subpoena. In a Monday night court filing, lawyers for the House, saying they represented the Intelligence Committee, asked the court to reject Fusion’s request. The legal challenge was made without support from Democrats, throwing into further question a tradition of bipartisanship in Congress on intelligence issues. Democrats, who are in the minority, and some Republicans on the House panel, want to investigate Russia’s role in the 2016 election, as well as allegations that Trump’s team colluded with the Kremlin. Moscow has denied meddling in the election and Trump has denied collusion. Representative Devin Nunes, the Intelligence Committee’s Republican chairman, and his allies have focused instead on other issues, including the activities of Fusion GPS. Some Republicans, including Senator Charles Grassley, who chairs the Senate Judiciary Committee, have charged that Fusion GPS took Russian money while compiling the dossier on Trump. “Domestic American clients paid for Fusion GPS to research Donald Trump, period. No Russian was involved, in any way, in the payment to Fusion GPS for this work,” Joshua Levy, an outside attorney for the firm, said in a statement to Reuters on Tuesday. A footnote in Monday’s court filing said that House lawyers went to court to enforce the subpoena with the authorization of the Bipartisan Legal Advisory Group of the entire House. But it added that the House’s “Democratic Leader and Democratic Whip decline to support the Group’s position in this case.” Representative Nancy Pelosi is the House Democratic leader, and Representative Steny Hoyer is the Democratic whip. The top Democrat on the Intelligence Committee, Representative Adam Schiff, was not immediately available for comment. In their court filing, the House lawyers argued that Fusion GPS had no right to quash a valid congressional subpoena. “The relief Plaintiff seeks is extraordinary and would directly impede an ongoing congressional investigation of the highest national importance,” they wrote in the filing. The filing confirmed that Nunes retained control of the committee’s Russia probe, despite saying in April he would step aside and let fellow Republican Representative Mike Conaway take charge. Nunes “did not ‘recuse’ himself from the investigation,” the document said. ",0,en

"Brexit bill gives UK ministers 'excessively wide' powers, parliament committee says. LONDON (Reuters) - A parliamentary committee on Thursday accused British Prime Minister Theresa May s government of giving ministers  excessively wide  powers in new bill to transfer EU law into British law. The bill in question sets out the government s plan for transposing European Union law into the British statute book as part of Brexit. But it creates scope for ministers to alter legislation without full parliamentary scrutiny in order to make sure laws works properly once transferred.  The bill gives ministers excessively wide legislative powers beyond what is necessary to ensure UK law works properly when the UK leaves the EU,  said a statement accompanying a report by a committee of lawmakers from parliament s unelected upper chamber, the House of Lords. The government has said the powers created by the bill are strictly limited to what is needed to allow for a smooth transition - something they say is necessary to give businesses certainty over the rules they will face when Britain s EU membership ends in March 2019. Nevertheless, May, whose Conservative Party does not have an outright majority in parliament, could be forced into making concessions to ease concerns from across the political spectrum to clear the remaining lawmaking stages. Thursday s critical report by the House of Lords Delegated Powers Committee set out an alternative proposal that would allow more rigorous scrutiny of changes that the government wants to make when transposing EU law. The report offers a taste of the resistance May can expect to find in the House of Lords, where her Conservatives peers are significantly outnumbered by rivals from other parties.  The Lords will have to approve the withdrawal bill before it can become law. Earlier this month the government cleared the first of many parliamentary hurdles, winning a vote on crucial legislation known as the EU withdrawal bill despite criticism that it amounted to a government power grab.

"INFAMOUS ROMANIAN HACKER Tells FOX News Host How “EASY” It Was To Hack Hillary’s Server [VIDEO]. Of course, America s favorite criminal candidate says America shouldn t believe the infamous hacker who claims he accessed her unsecured server because he s a  criminal.  LOL if anyone can spot a criminal, it s Crooked Hillary The infamous Romanian hacker known as  Guccifer,  speaking exclusively with Fox News, claimed he easily   and repeatedly   breached former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton s personal email server in early 2013. For me, it was easy   easy for me, for everybody,  Marcel Lehel Lazar, who goes by the moniker  Guccifer,  told Fox News from a Virginia jail where he is being held.Guccifer s potential role in the Clinton email investigation was first reported by Fox News last month. The hacker subsequently claimed he was able to access the server   and provided extensive details about how he did it and what he found   over the course of a half-hour jailhouse interview and a series of recorded phone calls with Fox News.Fox News could not independently confirm Lazar s claims.In response to Lazar s claims, the Clinton campaign issued a statement Wednesday night saying,  There is absolutely no basis to believe the claims made by this criminal from his prison cell. In addition to the fact he offers no proof to support his claims, his descriptions of Secretary Clinton s server are inaccurate. It is unfathomable that he would have gained access to her emails and not leaked them the way he did to his other victims. The former secretary of state s server held nearly 2,200 emails containing information now deemed classified, and another 22 at the  Top Secret  level. Via: FOX News",1,en

" Donald Trump Just Posted A BRUTAL Video That Shows How Much Everyone Hates Ted Cruz (VIDEO). Maybe this is Republican front-runner Donald Trump s strange way of celebrating April Fool s Day or maybe he s just being his normal, childish self, but The Donald has just posted a pretty hilarious video that boasts the fact that his GOP rival, Texas senator Ted Cruz, is highly unlikable.Cruz s unpopularity amongst not only the general public, but his Republican colleagues as well, has been widely reported on during this campaign. So much so, that there was even an analysis done on the offensiveness of Cruz s face! Trump is using this to his full advantage in his new Instagram video, which is so creatively entitled  Nobody Likes Ted The short video goes through several instances where Cruz s peers have insulted and spoken about how much they dislike him. Testimonials from Cruz s former college roommate Craig Mazin, old bosses like Bill O Reilly and fellow senators all get their fair share of the spotlight in footage that will surely take Cruz s ego down several notches.Mazin s appearance in the video was no surprise   he s spoken openly about his disdain for Cruz several times before. However, former Republican presidential nominee Bob Dole is an interesting addition, as he suggests he might  oversleep  on election day if Cruz is nominated. Senator Lindsey Graham, who chose to endorse Cruz s campaign over Trump s, has previously made it perfectly clear that his endorsement in no way means that he likes Cruz, and that he believes the Texas senator is just as bad as President Barack Obama,  if not worse.  Another hilarious part features Bill O Reilly telling Cruz that former President George W. Bush doesn t like him! At the end of the video, after Cruz gets slammed by basically everyone he s ever been close to, the text reads  TRUSTED? You can watch Trump s video below:Does anybody like Lyin  Ted?A video posted by Donald J. Trump (@realdonaldtrump) on Apr 1, 2016 at 11:38am PDTNow infamous for his constant flip-flopping, Trump s certainly singing a different tune than he was in September, when he praised Cruz and said,  I like him.

"BUSTED: [VIDEO] MAN ATTEMPTS TO TAPE “GOTCHA” VIDEO OF COPS ‘ABUSING THEIR POWERS’ And Gets Unexpected Challenge From Local News. The Michael Brown and Eric Garner cases have opened up so many doors for opportunists looking for their 15 seconds of fame  As an added bonus, we ve included Tony Soto s original  gotcha  video below. A video of a traffic stop by 15th district officers in Philadelphia has gone viral with more than 1 million views. The man in the video says officers abused their power but police are painting a very different picture.28-year-old Tony Soto recorded the traffic stop on his cellphone. I am not anti-police, I support the police. I just don t support police abusing their powers,  Soto told Action News.In the video, Soto showed his license, but refused to show his registration.Police are concerned about Soto s motives and criminal past. We are going to tell our officers to be cautious. It raises your level of suspicion when you have a person   a prior felony   and has had some prior interaction with the law and has been known to interact with guns. So we are going to tell our officers to be careful,  said Lt. John Sanford, Philadelphia Police.Soto sat down with Action News to discuss the controversial video. This traffic stop, just brought to light an ongoing issue that is continually denied all over our nation with individuals being stopped and in some cases being racially profiled,  said Soto.Soto says the officers who stopped him were not African-American but police say differently. They were African American officers,  said Lt. Stanford.The original reason for the stop was for tinted windows.Soto flashed a paper at the officer saying he had a medical exemption from PennDOT for sun screening on his car, but he didn t bring that letter to our meeting. If you were provided that certificate from PennDOT, it has to be colorless tint,  said Lt. Stanford.We asked Soto if his windows were dark tinted. Okay in your opinion or anyone else s opinion from watching the video tape   that s their opinion. No one knows what tint is on my vehicle, whether it s colored or colorless, although it may look dark,  said Soto.And then there s this   in the video, Soto held up a card and badge identifying himself to the officer as a fire marshal.We asked him if he s a fire marshal. The tape speaks for itself and, at this point, okay let s not take the focus as to who I am or what I do or what is going on and let s keep the focus on what is really going on. It is not about Tony Soto,  said Soto.So who is Soto?He s a felon, sentenced to 33 months in federal prison for straw purchasing firearms.He has multiple convictions for theft, fleeing from police, and was convicted of impersonating a public servant in 2005 and now claims he is a volunteer firefighter.We asked Soto where he works. Well we are going to   you are going to stop that right there alright   we are going to stop that and we are not going to go into that,  said Soto.Police are also cautioning the public not to use Soto s video as an example of what to do during a traffic stop.While it is legal to record video, the Pennsylvania vehicle code requires drivers to turn over their identification and registration.In addition, the Fraternal Order of Police is now asking authorities to pursue charges against Soto for allegedly impersonating a public servant.

" Conservative ‘Christian’ Leader Defends Pedophile GOP Candidate Roy Moore. It didn t take long for conservative  Christians  to jump to the defense of Roy Moore.Not long after the Washington Post published a story containing detailed accusations from several women who claim that Moore sexually assaulted and abused them as teens, conservatives disgustingly continued to back him despite having the opposite reaction to allegations against several high profile Hollywood actors and producers.And that s not to mention the reaction conservatives had when right-wing websites pushed a conspiracy claiming that Hillary Clinton ran a sex trafficking operation inside a pizza restaurant, a conspiracy that was immediately and thoroughly debunked.Conservatives STILL believe that conspiracy, but refuse to believe the very real victims who have come forward about Moore.Rather than call for Moore to step aside, conservative  Christians  are more rabid than ever, and that includes Jerry Falwell Jr., who along with the rest of his anti-gay friends still supports Moore just like they continued to support Donald Trump despite Trump saying on tape that he likes to grab women by their genitals without their consent. It comes down to a question who is more credible in the eyes of the voters   the candidate or the accuser,  Falwell said.  The same thing happened to President Trump a few weeks before his election last year except it was several women making allegations. He denied that any of them were true and the American people believed him and elected him the 45th president of the United States. And I believe the judge is telling the truth. So Falwell Jr. is making Moore s guilt contingent on whether voters elect him or not. In other words, he s telling Republican voters that electing him is the equivalent of a jury verdict of  not guilty. But that s not how the justice system works. And it s not how we should be judging political candidates.It should be pointed out that the race in Alabama has turned into a dead heat according to a poll taken after the bombshell story dropped, so clearly voters must not think Moore is very credible.These are credible allegations that should be taken seriously. Seriously enough that Moore should be forced to withdraw his candidacy. The fact that conservatives are using the Bible to defend sexual abuse and assault proves that they are nothing more than fake Christians. They would support a pedophile rather than vote for a Democrat. That s how far conservative  Christians  have fallen. They are literally supporting a man who claimed that homosexuality causes pedophilia, the same man who is being accused of predatory sexual behavior involving a 14-year-old girl. Only Moore is a straight white  Christian  so conservatives think his pedophilia is acceptable.Hillary Clinton was right. These people are deplorable.Featured Image: Scott Olson/Getty Images",1,en

"Trump loaned White House campaign $7.5 million as he nears Republican nomination. (Reuters) - Donald Trump raised $1.7 million from donors and loaned his White House campaign $7.5 million in April as he moved closer to becoming the Republican nominee for president, according to documents filed with the U.S. Federal Election Commission (FEC) on Friday. The New York businessman had loaned his campaign a total of $43.5 million as of the end of April, the filings showed. More recently, he has made moves to build up his fundraising operation with an eye toward the Nov. 8 general election. Trump became the Republican Party’s presumptive nominee in early May, when both of his rivals dropped out of the race. Trump self-funded much of his primary run, but he has said he will not rely as heavily on his own money for the general election, when he will face the Democratic nominee. Both people seeking the Democratic nomination have raised more than Trump. Hillary Clinton, the party’s front-runner, brought in $26.4 million in April, including funds from a joint fundraising effort with the Democratic Party.  An outside Super PAC supporting her campaign raised $8.6 million. A Super PAC is a fund-raising group that must operate separate from political campaigns but can raise unlimited sums. U.S. Senator Bernie Sanders, Clinton’s rival for the Democratic nomination, raised $26.9 million in April. He has disavowed Super PACs. Trump has criticized them too, though a long-time Republican operative in May joined one Super PAC backing the real estate mogul. In May, Trump hired investor Steven Mnuchin as his national finance chairman and entered a joint fundraising deal with the Republican National Committee that will allow donors to write much bigger checks. Friday’s FEC filings do not reflect these moves, but they show that Trump’s fundraising dipped in April, after he brought in about $3 million and loaned himself $11.5 million in March.  He also spent less in April, $9.4 million compared with $13.8 million a month earlier, when more states held nominating contests. Trump spent $2.6 million on advertising in April, less than half the $6.3 million he spent in March. By comparison, Sanders spent $17.3 million and Clinton spent $9.3 million on advertising in April.     Trump’s consulting and payroll spending also dropped about 30 percent to a total $1.7 million in April, even as he added experienced political staff. At the end of March, he hired veteran Republican strategist Paul Manafort.      Trump ended April with $2.4 million on hand, after starting the month with $2.1 million at the ready. ",0,en

This cannot be their second Christmas where their rights are dependent on negotiations.   Next is transition. Concrete assurances will build confidence and help firms across the UK and Europe to pause their contingency planning.  TheCityUK FINANCIAL SERVICES TRADE BODY CEO MILES CELIC  This agreement in principle between the UK and the EU to move beyond phase one is a positive and encouraging step.  For the financial and related professional services industry, our critical issues must now be progressed.   The sand in the timer is running out - leave it too late and damage will be done to both the UK and the EU. European competitiveness will ultimately be weakened as functionality will likely leave Europe for other international financial centers.  Given the dominance of services to both the British and EU economies, it is essential that a Free Trade Agreement covers goods and services, and is based on mutual recognition and regulatory cooperation. This will be in the best interests of the UK, the EU27 and for global stability. It is also vital that existing services contracts can be grandfathered post-Brexit.  EEF MANUFACTURERS  ASSOCIATION CHIEF EXECUTIVE STEPHEN PHIPSON  This is one step forward in a complex and long process. So we need to pin down the transition arrangements, which will be in place after March 2019, to ensure it s business as usual for companies for as long as it takes until a final deal is reached. Until we get to that point, many businesses will need to prepare for any and every eventuality.   Many employers will be relieved that their EU employees have more certainty going forward, and government must now clarify the rights of EU citizens by Christmas so that they are not concerned about their future.  FEDERATION OF SMALL BUSINESSES NATIONAL CHAIRMAN MIKE CHERRY  The UK s millions of small businesses will be pleased to hear that finally it appears the Brexit talks are about to move onto the second stage.   The focus must now shift to the UK s future trading relationship with the EU. This should include by early next year a guarantee that there will be no cliff-edge moment on Brexit day, but instead an orderly, time-limited transition period so that small firms only have one set of rule changes. The final deal must have as few barriers to trade as possible.  ",0,en
"BREAKING: OBAMA POISED To Exact Revenge On PUTIN With Unprecedented Cyber Attack For Allegedly Exposing Hillary Emails…While Campaigning For Hillary. Putin Tells Russian Army To Prepare For WWWIII With U.S While Obama whines about Trump campaigns for Hillary Is our Community Organizer In Chief actually willing to put our nation s security at risk because he believes Putin is responsible for Hillary s email hacks? What kind of sick, reckless and vengeful clown do we have running our nation? The Obama administration is contemplating an unprecedented cyber covert action against Russia in retaliation for alleged Russian interference in the American presidential election, U.S. intelligence officials told NBC News.Current and former officials with direct knowledge of the situation say the CIA has been asked to deliver options to the White House for a wide-ranging  clandestine  cyber operation designed to harass and  embarrass  the Kremlin leadership.The sources did not elaborate on the exact measures the CIA was considering, but said the agency had already begun opening cyber doors, selecting targets and making other preparations for an operation. Former intelligence officers told NBC News that the agency had gathered reams of documents that could expose unsavory tactics by Russian President Vladimir Putin.Vice President Joe Biden told  Meet the Press  moderator Chuck Todd on Friday that  we re sending a message  to Putin and that  it will be at the time of our choosing, and under the circumstances that will have the greatest impact. When asked if the American public will know a message was sent, the vice president replied,  Hope not. Retired Admiral James Stavridis told NBC News  Cynthia McFadden that the U.S. should attack Russia s ability to censor its internal internet traffic and expose the financial dealings of Putin and his associates.   NBC NewsFULL REPORT: @NBCNews has learned the CIA is preparing a major unprecedented cyber-strike against Russia. @CynthiaMcFadden reports pic.twitter.com/MjxKrdL7zS  NBC Nightly News (@NBCNightlyNews) October 14, 2016Vladimir Zhirinovsky, a flamboyant veteran lawmaker known for his fiery rhetoric, told Reuters in an interview that Trump was the only person able to de-escalate dangerous tensions between Moscow and Washington.Americans should vote for Donald Trump as president next month or risk being dragged into a nuclear war, according to a Russian ultra-nationalist ally of President Vladimir Putin who likes to compare himself to the U.S. Republican candidate.By contrast, Trump s Democratic rival Hillary Clinton could spark World War Three, said Zhirinovsky, who received a top state award from Putin after his pro-Kremlin Liberal Democratic Party of Russia (LDPR) came third in Russia s parliamentary election last month.Zhirinovsky s comments coincide with deep disagreements between Washington and Moscow over Syria and Ukraine and after the White House last week accused Russia of a campaign of cyber attacks against Democratic Party organizations.Even as WikiLeaks released another trove of internal documents from Clinton s campaign on Wednesday, Putin insisted his country was not involved in an effort to influence the U.S. presidential election.

"Obama And Kerry Exposed: Secret Side Deals With Iran And No Nuclear Agreement. Bravo! These two great Americans make me have hope for the politicians we elect. They re doing a damn good job of exposing the phony Iran deal. They both are veterans and super smart so maybe they ve been able to outsmart the Obama thugs. I love these guys!Rep. Mike Pompeo (R   Kan.) and Sen. Tom Cotton (R   Ark.) have a lot in common. Both are army veterans and both are graduates of Harvard Law School. And both have been doing a great job of exposing aspects of the nuclear deal with Iran that the administration would rather keep quiet.This week it was reported that an inquiry from Pompeo got the State Department to admit that the nuclear deal was never signed and is not  legally binding. Julia Frifield, the Assistant Secretary of State for Legislative Affairs, wrote in response to Pompeo s inquiry if he could see the signed agreement, in a letter reproduced at the congressman s website, that the nuclear deal was not binding and that it was not signed by any party. The key parts of the letter read:The Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA) is not a treaty or an executive agreement, and is not a signed document   The success of the JCPOA will depend not on whether it is legally binding or signed, but rather on the extensive verification measures we have put in place, as well as Iran s understanding that we have the capacity to re-impose   and ramp up   our sanctions if Iran does not meet its commitments.Frifield asserted that the JCPOA was not a signed agreement but  reflections of political commitments  between Iran and the P5+1 nations   the United States, Britain, France, China, Russia and Germany.Pompeo responded,  For the State Department to try to defend the unsigned and non-binding Iran nuclear agreement by calling it a  political commitment  is about as absurd as the terms of the deal itself.   Instead of forging an agreement with Iran that will protect Americans and prevent the world s largest state sponsor of terror from obtaining a nuclear weapon, the Obama administration caved to Iranian bullies and serial nuclear cheaters. Unsigned, this agreement is nothing more than a press release and just about as enforceable. Pompeo, of course, knew that the deal was unsigned, but he got the State Department to admit it. What Cotton s letter did was expose the administration s ploy to evade Congressional oversight and still achieve the permanence of a treaty by going to the U.N. Security Council.The non-binding nature of the nuclear non-agreement isn t the only subterfuge that Cotton and Pompeo have exposed. It was also their questioning that led to the discovery of the secret side deals between Iran and the IAEA. One of the side deals allowed Iran to collect its own samples at the Parchin military base, an arrangement that non-proliferation experts Olli Heinonen, a former deputy director of the IAEA, and David Albright, head of the Institute for Science and International Security, said undermined the effectiveness of the JCPOA. (The scandal of self-inspection of Parchin had previously been brought up by Sen. Robert Menendez (D   N.J.) and Sen. James Risch (R   Idaho).)Cotton and Pompeo have been very good at exposing the weakness of the deal that the media wouldn t otherwise have reported. No doubt in the coming months Iran will continue testing the administration and the administration will continue retreating exposing further weaknesses in the deal. ",1,en
